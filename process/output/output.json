                        "answer": "As I think about what could be trimmed to keep this project focused, a few elements stand out. First, creating a polished visual identity right away\u2014like a fancy logo and full brand guidelines\u2014probably isn\u2019t essential at this stage. It would take a lot of time that might be better spent getting the core community up and running. A simple, clean look should be enough for now.\nSecond, launching monthly webinars immediately could be too much. They take a lot of effort to plan and promote, and without an existing audience, turnout might be low. It might make more sense to hold off until there\u2019s more interest.\nThird, putting together a full press kit could wait until the project has some traction. Media outreach is great, but it\u2019s probably more effective once there\u2019s content and engagement to show.\nFourth, building a huge resource library could feel overwhelming, both for me to maintain and for people to navigate early on. Starting small and growing it over time might work better.\nFinally, mapping out a detailed content calendar from day one could be premature since I don\u2019t yet know what topics will resonate most. Staying flexible and adjusting as I learn more will likely be more useful.\nEven so, there are two pieces I\u2019d really want to keep. One is the resource library. Having a core set of helpful materials from the start will make the community feel credible and give people a reason to come back. The other is running webinars, even if they\u2019re simple. Live sessions are great for building connection and helping people feel like they\u2019re part of something active. They can also help surface engaged members who might contribute more later on.\nOverall, simplifying some parts will help me focus on what really matters: creating value for early members and building momentum."

We want to focus on risks related to AI (or propose solutions that incorporate AI)\nReasons to keep: Risk is very significant (in terms of scale), + nuances of this risk are not discussed in literature. There are also ways of incorporating AI into discussion of this risk (e.g. by discussing how AI significantly exacerbates the issue, or can be part of the solution).\nPotential element to cut: Solutions\nReasons to remove: Scope may be too large if we include solutions. Could just focus on risks instead\nReasons to keep: We want to put forward something positive! If producers, legislators, etc, are not aware of any feasible solutions to the problems we put forward, then they may just be ignored.\nPotential element to cut: Contextually sensitive practical solutions\nReasons to remove: Including this would massively increase the scope of the paper.\nReasons to keep: Would satisfy our goal of providing generally practical recommendations.

Emotional character development (e.g. inner monologue in comic strip)\nSimplifying or abstracting the character could leave more room for the ethical framework itself to shine, especially in short-form visual storytelling.\n\nB. Policy memo artefact\nThe policy memo is well-developed but may be too \u201cdocument-heavy\u201d for visual-first audiences.\n\nIt might be better included as an optional appendix or linked artifact, rather than a core deliverable in a fast-paced, visual toolkit.\n\nC. Low-impact speculative futures cone\nAlthough useful for personal clarity, the futures cone may not offer direct value to the viewer unless explicitly integrated into facilitation or learning materials.\n\nCould risk coming across as abstract unless paired with clear prompts or use cases.\n\nD. Multiple variations of the toolkit (tailored per audience)\nWhile audience segmentation is important, attempting to build multiple formats in the time remaining could dilute impact.\n\nInstead, I could prioritise one well-designed \u201cuniversal\u201d version and simply recommend adaptations. OR focus on one audience only.\n\n Blockchain technical explanations\nThe technical inner workings of blockchain may not be essential to the audience\u2019s understanding.\n\nCould be simplified to focus on the function of trust and traceability, rather than how it works under the hood.\n\nDefending Two Elements I Will Keep\nA. Policy Memo (EFTP-2035-04)\nWhy it stays:\n\nIt provides critical worldbuilding: The policy memo anchors the speculative future in bureaucratic realism, making the scenario feel plausible and grounded.\n\nIt speaks directly to one of my target audiences\u2014policymakers and system thinkers\u2014who need to see not just what the idea is, but how it could be operationalised in the real world.\n\nIt adds credibility and structure to the scenario, demonstrating foresight beyond emotional storytelling.\nB. Emotional character moment in comic strip\nWhy it stays:\nThe entire project rests on connecting systemic complexity to individual ethical decision-making.\n\nIncluding a quiet moment\u2014like the character pausing before making a choice\u2014invites the viewer to emotionally place themselves in the story. This is vital for the speculative fiction to engage the viewer. "

Automated transcription (or recording) of business meetings\nWhile it could be a helpful feature, it is not central to the tool\u2019s core purpose: empowering advocates with strong, data-driven arguments. Additionally, it may introduce challenges rather than solve them: particularly around data privacy, consent, and the potential reluctance of businesses to allow recordings.\n3. Company-specific tailoring in prototype\nWhilst tailoring insights for specific companies adds value to the prototype, it would require more time and access to real business data. In this instance, sample data and hypothetical cases may be enough to validate the tool's core utility.\n4. Full stakeholder interviews\nThey would be valuable, yet take time to schedule and analyse. At this stage, we can replace full stakeholder interviews with assumptions and feedback.\n5. Tool branding or naming (\"PlantShift AI\")\nI liked the idea of adding a specific branding and settle on a name for the tool to enhance storytelling, but I recognise is not a priority at the prototype stage and could take away energy from focusing on functionality.\n\nTo keep:\n1. Automated presentation output (generating slides/presentations)\nReasons to keep:\n- Valuable as it helps overcome a common barrier for advocates: limited time and communication design skills.\n- Translates insights into ready-to-use material for business stakeholders, increasing the chances that insights will lead to action.\n- Adds a layer of professionalism and real-world usability that differentiates the tool from being \u201cjust a database.\u201d\n\n2. Business-focused, data-driven advocacy support format\nReasons to keep:\n- This tool fills a key gap in the advocacy space by helping campaigners influence corporate decisions through financial, market, and operational insights.\n- It supports strategic B2B conversations, not just public messaging - positioning plant-based expansion as a business opportunity, not just ethics.\n- Distinctly differentiates the tool from others in the space like Open Paws\u2019 tool by focusing on internal persuasion, decision-making\n"

Custom Web User Interface (UI) for Data Display\n\nReason: Substantial front-end effort, diverting resources from core data pipeline. Initially, use database console or pre-built tools. Proves data capabilities without UI overhead, accelerating MVP.\n\n3. Real-time Sentiment Analysis of Extracted Articles\n\nReason: Adds computational complexity and API costs. Nuanced, prone to bias, requires careful model validation. For initial phase, core extraction and basic filtering suffice; progressively add sophisticated AI.\n\nDefending Core Components: Why They Are Vital\nDespite streamlining arguments, certain elements are vital to \"AI for Animals\" project success and cannot be cut.\n\n1. Custom Web User Interface (UI) for Data Display\n\nDefense: UI is vital; it transforms raw data into actionable intelligence for advocates/politically active. Without intuitive UI, data is inaccessible. It's the primary gateway for user interaction, search, and insight, making project value apparent and enabling rapid identification of policy discussions for strategic action.\n\n2. Real-time Sentiment Analysis of Extracted Articles\n\nDefense: Sentiment analysis is vital for elevating the project to intelligent advocacy support. Understanding tone and reception of animal issues is crucial. It enables advocates to quickly identify opportunities (positive narratives) and threats (negative trends). This capability creates \"Advocacy Digests\" as strategic tools, guiding engagement by highlighting how an issue is being perceived. It's a cornerstone for actionable intelligence."

Right now, the answer is: no one really knows. That\u2019s a problem\u2014because decisions we make today could either lock in neglect, or build a future where animal welfare truly matters.\n\nOur project tackles this overlooked issue by asking: How can we make sure animals are ethically considered before transformative AI arrives?\n\nTo answer this, we reviewed expert perspectives from AI safety, animal welfare, and effective altruism communities. We identified \u201ctime-sensitive\u201d interventions\u2014things we should act on now, while AI norms are still forming. These include:\n\nMaking sure animal welfare is represented in AI training data\n\nIncluding animals in future-focused ethical guidelines and policy frameworks\n\nSupporting early collaboration between AI labs and animal advocacy groups\n\nWe also explored how future AI systems might impact animal lives, such as through lab-grown meat, wildlife monitoring, or even direct policy advising. Our approach blends research, stakeholder interviews, and scenario planning to imagine how emerging technologies can help\u2014not harm\u2014non-human animals.\n\nWhat\u2019s next? We plan to publish a brief and host a community workshop to get feedback and grow momentum. But we need your help.\n\nCall to action:\nIf you're working on AI, ethics, or policy\u2014or simply care about sentient beings\u2014fill out our interest form by Friday to join the feedback group or pilot discussions. Together, we can ensure animals are part of the future we\u2019re building.\n\n"

How would you respond?\nCritics may ask, \u201cWhy focus on animals when AI already poses serious risks to humans?\u201d I\u2019d respond that moral circle expansion is not zero-sum; incorporating animal welfare early is tractable, low-cost, and prevents value lock-in that excludes billions of sentient beings.\n\nWho is your target audience &amp; what do they care about?\nMy main audience includes AI governance researchers, effective altruists, and ethical policymakers. They care about reducing large-scale suffering, ensuring the safe deployment of AI, and identifying overlooked areas with high expected impact.\n\nHow might your pitch need to be adapted or tailored for them?\nSince this audience is familiar with longtermism, existential risk, and AI policy, the pitch should emphasize how animal-inclusive governance builds on those principles. Rather than introducing new moral frameworks, I connect our project to familiar concerns like value alignment, institutional lock-in, and neglectedness.\n\nWhat difficulties or doubts might they have about your project, &amp; how would you address these proactively?\nThey might doubt the practical relevance or urgency of animal-focused governance interventions. I\u2019d counter this by highlighting feasible entry points\u2014like improving dataset standards, institutional ethics norms, or red-teaming AI systems for animal harm risks\u2014that align with their existing policy agendas.\n\nHow does your project advance your career goals?\nThe project strengthens my profile at the intersection of AI governance and ethical policymaking. It develops my ability to address neglected cause areas, design actionable policy interventions, and think critically about moral inclusion in long-term institutional design\u2014skills central to my future work in global priorities and AI policy."

The few individuals working on AI for animal welfare are isolated across disciplines and geographies. This fragmentation holds back progress and results in duplicated efforts, missed partnerships, and lost opportunities to apply AI tools where they could help animals the most.\n\nOur approach:\nWe are building the People in AI Directory, a simple and accessible online platform that connects AI researchers, citizen scientists, nonprofit staff, and academics who work on or care about animal welfare. The platform allows users to find collaborators, share datasets, exchange ideas, and discover projects across the globe. Think of it as a public infrastructure for coordination, knowledge-sharing, and building the field of animal-inclusive AI.\n\nImpact:\nIn just a few weeks, we have built the platform\u2019s first version, reached out to over 50 early stakeholders, and begun onboarding initial members. We also created core infrastructure for researcher profiles, project tagging, and a secure dataset submission process. Our next step is to refine the platform based on feedback, expand our outreach across Asia and other underrepresented regions, and prepare for a public beta launch in late 2025.\n\nCall to action:\nWe are inviting AI researchers, nonprofits, and academics interested in this intersection to join our early access group by signing up at peopleinai.org/join before September 15. Help shape a community where AI works for animals."

Artificial intelligence has enormous potential to help. But there\u2019s a gap: people with ideas often can\u2019t find the right collaborators with the technical, scientific, or advocacy skills to bring projects to life. This slows progress and keeps promising solutions from scaling.\n\nWe\u2019ve created the AI for Animals Collaborative Hub\u2014a simple online platform that acts like a matchmaking site for good. It connects researchers, technologists, advocates, and funders who want to work on projects at the intersection of AI and animal welfare. You can post a project idea or skillset you\u2019re offering, browse others\u2019 profiles, and quickly form teams with complementary expertise. The Hub also includes resources and monitoring services to ensure people have easy pathways to find their ideal collaboration partners.\n\nIn just a few weeks we have come up with a website design and main features that we are going to implement in our platform as soon as possible! A community of researchers, social science professionals and developers working together to develop a single project, just like users in our platform could. Currently, we\u2019re expanding our network, refining the platform based on feedback, and planning to implement more valuable resourses and ways to stay in conact with ourr users.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be part of this growing community, join our beta today.

A tough question might be: \u201cWhy do you believe that simply connecting people will result in meaningful impact rather than more talk and less action?\u201d I would respond that while collaboration alone doesn\u2019t guarantee results, evidence from similar hubs in related fields shows that structured matchmaking combined with resources and follow-up dramatically increases the likelihood of viable projects being launched and sustained. Especially within young professionals who are trying to break into the industry, but do not know how.\n\n3. Our target audience is people who are passionate about improving animal welfare who care about practical, scalable solutions and are eager to collaborate across disciplines but often don\u2019t know where to start, or need advice.\n\n4. For advocates who have no real AI knowledge,, the pitch should emphasize real-world examples of AI applications that have successfully improved animal outcomes, while for technologists, it should highlight the novelty and research potential.\n\n5. Potential doubts include skepticism that enough qualified people will join to make the hub valuable, or that it will be hard to maintain engagement over time; to adress this i would use examples of successful proyects similar to ours, to exemplify how it may look once it is a concrete platform.\n\n6.This project advances my career goals by allowing me to fortify my advocacy and communications abilities, as well as project management.

Urban policies rarely consider animal welfare, leaving advocates struggling to push for changes like bird-safe building codes or humane urban wildlife control. They lack access to the legal data, local precedents, and strategic guidance needed to draft effective, tailored proposals - and that gap stalls progress.\nOur Approach\nWe\u2019re creating Pawlicy Pal, an AI-powered tool designed to help animal advocates and urban planners draft stronger, locally-relevant policies. Pawlicy Pal analyzes city ordinances, environmental data, and precedent-setting policies to generate custom policy language, strategic framing advice, and real-world examples. Whether someone wants to propose non-lethal rodent control, bird-friendly building regulations, or zoning changes to support animal sanctuaries, our tool helps translate good ideas into actionable, politically viable proposals.\nImpact &amp; Next Steps\nSo far, we\u2019ve developed an early prototype of Pawlicy Pal, conducted user interviews with advocates and stakeholders, and created wireframes for the tool\u2019s design. Through this research, we\u2019ve identified key policy areas where cities can make meaningful change and pinpointed the core features our tool must deliver to be effective for users in practice.\nOur next step is to refine the prototype for a pilot city, working directly with local advocates to test real policy scenarios. This will help us strengthen our tool and ensure it\u2019s both usable and effective in the hands of changemakers.\nCall to Action\nWe\u2019re looking for advocates, urban planners, and city officials to join our pilot program launching this fall. If you care about building animal-friendly cities, sign up to help us test the beta tool and shape its development. Together, we can make sure animals aren\u2019t just managed - they\u2019re prioritized.\nPawlicy Pal - \"Building Cities Where Animals Belong\""

As different types of speciesism affect animals in different ways, it's important to be able to identify ways in which the current models lack. Moreover, a great percentage of users prefer to use LLMs in their native tongue, making the results of English-focused speciesism irrelevant for the majority of users. The current research shows that answers of LLM models regarding moral questions vary from the language of the prompts, thereby suggesting that such cases should also be studied in non-English languages. \n2-I am aiming to create a new speciesism test that has varied categories of speciesism and test it out on different languages and different models\n3-I am currently in the step of researching the literature in order to come up with improved categories of speciesism that cover all the relevant and important types of speciesism that have an impact on the welfare of the animals.

It can be used to detect diseases early on, identify when animals are hungry and respond accordingly, and better help farmers understand when farm animals experience pain, stress, or discomfort. [slide 2 - picture of miserable animals on AI farm] But AI also has the potential to significantly worsen farm animal welfare. It could make mistakes and cause great suffering as a result, decrease our empathy and concern towards farm animals, and lead to further intensification and cramped living conditions. [slide 3] Our paper seeks to address these concerns by identifying the major welfare risks associated with AI enhanced livestock farming, and providing clear, well-researched, and practical guidelines for addressing these risks.\n[slide 4] In doing so, we hope to fill in several gaps in the literature. While some papers have already touched on some of the animal welfare risks associated with precision-livestock farming (PLF), little attention has been paid to the risks that stem from AI enhanced PLF in particular. Furthermore, we believe that much more can, and should, be said about what solutions will address these risks, and the practical steps that can be taken to resolve these issues.\n[slide 5] So what can you do?

It can be used to detect diseases early on, identify when animals are hungry and respond accordingly, and better help farmers understand when farm animals experience pain, stress, or discomfort. [slide 2 - picture of miserable animals on AI farm] But AI also has the potential to significantly worsen farm animal welfare. It could make mistakes and cause great suffering as a result, decrease our empathy and concern towards farm animals, and lead to further intensification and cramped living conditions. [slide 3] Our paper seeks to address these concerns by identifying the major welfare risks associated with AI enhanced livestock farming, and providing clear, well-researched, and practical guidelines for addressing these risks.\n[slide 4] In doing so, we hope to fill in several gaps in the literature. While some papers have already touched on some of the animal welfare risks associated with precision-livestock farming (PLF), little attention has been paid to the risks that stem from AI enhanced PLF in particular. Furthermore, we believe that much more can, and should, be said about what solutions will address these risks, and the practical steps that can be taken to resolve these issues.\n[slide 5] So what can you do?

Target audience: Policy makers, researchers, decision-makers\n4. We can build on the PLF lesson materials - we can assume that they will understand the risks and benefits without much detailed explanation.\n5.

                        "answer": "AI has the potential to revolutionize animal welfare, and this is a quickly growing field. However, since this field is so new, it can be challenging to connect with professionals in the field, and there is no central source of information. Research in this field can have a wide range of positive effects, from improving farmed-animal welfare to understanding your pets. In this type of research especially, citizen science is extremely important, and it is important to have a way for citizen scientists to get involved.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re creating People in AI, a directory of research at the intersection of AI and animal welfare. At its core, it will be a place for researchers and citizen scientists to collaborate. We will have a directory of researchers and projects, which people can filter by topic, allowing participants to find more relevant research happening in the field; and we will have a forum where researchers can put out calls for citizen scientists. This forum would also serve as a place to ask questions and exchange ideas and feedback. We are also hoping to eventually expand the platform to include additional features, such as data sharing, mentorship programs, and online events.\n\nUltimately, we hope this will facilitate greater collaboration in the field, and connect citizen scientists with researchers who could use their data. We have not found any databases with this scope and the ability to communicate directly through the platform, and by filling this niche, we will help to ensure that AI and animal welfare research reaches its full potential.\n\nWe are still in the early stages of developing the project; we have a basic website design, but we are still working on the legal aspects before we can publish the website. We are also working on securing funding to cover the website domain, any fees for consulting with a lawyer, and any software we would need to purchase to create and run the directory.\n\nIn the meantime, we are collecting feedback on the project, as well as testimonials to promote the project and support our funding applications. If you\u2019d like to support us, please fill out our feedback form, and if you are willing, you can also provide a testimonial in a separate form. Please also send me a message if you would like early access."

The hardest question to answer is what the platform will achieve before it has many participants, since the directory relies on a large number of people using the platform. I would respond by saying first that we hope to start out with a solid group of people, since we are connected in some way to the major groups in this field and plan to contact as many people as we can and offer early access. Additionally, once we get the word out, those who are most interested in collaborating or reaching out to a wider audience are the most likely to use our platform.\n3. The target audience is academic researchers, research organizations, independent researchers, and citizen scientists. Researchers care about having access to information, conducting their research effectively, and securing funding; citizen scientists care about supporting research.\n4. For citizen scientists, the pitch could be adapted to emphasize how it would make their role easier (and for those who are hoping to advance their career, that it would provide relevant opportunities). For researchers, it could be adapted to list more specific ways it could aid them in their work.\n5. Researchers might have concerns about data security. To address this, I will note that we currently will not have sensitive data stored on our site; information about current research projects will only be what researchers choose to share. Additionally, we will be consulting with a lawyer about our data policies.\n6. I am hoping to go to graduate school and research interspecies communication as part of my studies. Since it is a relatively small field that greatly benefits from central places for communication and from citizen science, I believe it\u2019s directly relevant to the field."

Why? Because they prioritise profit and risk reduction. Without strong, data-backed cases showing that plant-based innovation is profitable and in demand, they\u2019re unlikely to act and prefer to play it safe within the ways they\u2019ve always done things.\nThat\u2019s where Plantshift AI comes in.\nThis tool is designed to help advocates and consultants in the field build compelling, profit-oriented business cases. It will provide real-time, tailored insights \u2013 including market trends, consumer demand, regional and demographic data, and examples of what competitors are doing successfully. All of it backed by reliable and provable sources.\nThe prototype I\u2019m presenting in Lovable is a simulation of what the real tool could look like. The final version would be a website-based AI system, with a chatbot-style interface where the user inputs information from business conversations \u2013 like a company\u2019s concerns or questions \u2013 and the tool responds with relevant, data-backed insights.\nThe engine behind it would draw from a curated dataset of validated sources and studies, along with manually added industry insights. One standout feature: it could automatically generate polished presentation slides or summary reports, making it easier to follow up with companies quickly and persuasively.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nI\u2019m now looking for feedback from people working in this space \u2013 animal advocates, plant-based consultants, corporate campaigners \u2013 to test and refine the concept.\nIf this sounds like something you\u2019d use or want to shape, please fill out my short feedback form by Friday. It only takes 5 minutes, and your input will help guide how Plantshift AI takes shape:\nhttps://forms.gle/vDuH84Z6RYom8zsB7\nThanks so much!\n\nLink to the tool preview: https://preview--veggie-biz-boost.lovable.app/\n"

It can be difficult without sounding overly technical or abstract.\n2. The hardest questions might be around the reliability and objectivity of the responses/data provided.\nTo address this concern, the tool will draw from validated, regularly updated sources like GFI reports, market trend databases, and custom surveys from advocates in the field.

They may doubt whether this tool can generate higher quality insights than a generic AI chatbot drawing from the wide web and whether it\u2019s worth investing time learning a new system. I\u2019d address this by highlighting that this tool draws from a carefully curated and purpose-specific dataset, including niche academic papers and insights that might be too specialised or under-represented in mainstream AI like ChatGPT. Additionally, its ability to turn these insights into tailored, presentation-ready outputs adds significant value, saving advocates time.\n6. As an animal advocate with experience in corporate engagement, I\u2019ve seen first-hand the challenges addressed by this tool. While my current role is broader, it still aligns with this mission and looking ahead, I hope to establish my own consultancy focused on supporting plant-based transitions. This tool directly supports that vision, offering a foundation for a service I could scale and refine as part of my future practice."

AI is not magic; it is statistical pattern recognition. Explaining this balance between AI\u2019s power and its limits in plain terms can be tricky but important to set realistic expectations.\nWhat is the hardest question a critic might ask?\nWhich question is that? How do you know this tool will actually improve campaigns or policy outcomes and not just produce more data?\nHow would I respond? Great question. The goal is not just more data but actionable insights. We design the platform around the needs of campaign teams providing clear summaries, timely alerts, and trend predictions proven by studies to increase campaign impact by twenty to fifty percent. We also plan early user testing with real advocacy groups to iteratively improve usefulness and measure impact on their outcomes.\nWho is your target audience and what do they care about?\nPrimary target audience is animal advocacy groups and campaign teams in Latin America initially and later similar groups in Asia. What they care about are limited budgets, accessible and affordable technology, timely insights that can help them run more effective campaigns and language and local context relevance.\nHow might your pitch need to be tailored?\nFor advocacy groups focus on practical benefits save time, spot opportunities, respond faster. For funders or partners emphasize impact potential and cost-effectiveness. For tech collaborators highlight the AI innovation and open-source opportunities. Build on their existing knowledge of campaigns and storytelling showing how data and AI amplify those strengths.\nWhat doubts might they have and how to address them?\nDoubt number one is will this be too complicated or expensive? Answer: We prioritize user-friendly design and are seeking funding to subsidize costs making it accessible even to small groups. Doubt number two is can AI really understand the nuances? Answer: We are fine-tuning models on local language and sector-specific content plus incorporating human feedback loops for continuous improvement. "

This study conceptually investigates a path as per which these future extraordinary entities could spiral into monsterization, especially among Western cultures. Specifically, this proposed \u201ccascade of monsterization\u201d begins at the perception of these extraordinary, novel entities as abominations or aberrant entities vis-\u00e0-vis the ostensible natural order. It continues with the displacement of those aberrant entities into forced and prolonged liminality, which can then almost effortlessly lead to their monsterization by rendering them hostile towards the Human, thereby justifying their extermination. The cascade of monsterization ends with their potential exploitation as folk devils in moral panics, in which the hegemonic order gets bolstered by means of their persecution. Given the detrimental effects that any of these stages of the cascade can have on the aforementioned entities, alongside the vested interests of actors in pushing them through it until the very end, it is argued that effectively breaking this cascade requires obstructing the perception of those entities as aberrant ones in the first place. A promising starting point for such an intervention is discussed, in light of the existential psychological complications involved in a worldview revision whose target has a core role in a worldview\u2019s configuration."

My project works to reduce busywork for the Stanford Humane and Sustainable food lab with an AI tool for data labelling. The script I wrote takes messy restaurant order data, gives it to Gemini, and returns clean labels for each item, so that it's clear whether the item is vegetarian, vegan, or meat based (with fish, chicken, or red meat). With the tool, no one has to manually go through all the items and sort them by hand. The data is ready for data analysts to look for trends.so they can determine if restaurants sell more plant based items when they're present on their menu, therefore reducing meat consumption and animal suffering.

                        "answer": "1. What is the hardest part to explain simply?\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the nuances of the restaurant data and why we need it labelled. I have a simple framing of the problem when I\u2019m telling people briefly, but it\u2019s more complicated than it sounds because the data is of orders from restaurants, with modifications and typos, and without ingredients lists for many things. I think I could make that more clear.\n2. What do you predict will be the hardest question to answer from a critic? How would you respond?\nA question I\u2019ve already received: Could there be more sales of vegan items at these restaurants because more vegans go to them?\nThis is difficult to answer because I\u2019m not the one making decisions for the lab, so I don\u2019t know many of their long term plans to control for these sort of issues. Probably the best way to respond would be to talk to my advisor about that and understand the project better.\n3. Who is your target audience &amp; what do they care about?\nThe target audience for the script is Stanford researchers, but maybe the script could somehow be adapted for researchers in general or I could make new scripts for others tailored to their specific data/scenarios. \n4. How might your pitch need to be adapted or tailored for them? (e.g. What do they already know &amp; how can you build on that?)\nTo make this pitch more tailored to researchers in general, I could probably make it more of a pitch about my own ability to optimize tasks with AI, and the ask at the end could be for them to contact me if they would like me to work with them to automate monotonous tasks in their labs.\n5. What difficulties or doubts might they have about your project, &amp; how would you address these proactively?\nI haven\u2019t yet solved the problem very effectively. The code still has a lot of issues and returns some hallucinated results. \nI could work more on optimizing my prompts to Gemini to reduce hallucinations, and put checks into the code to delete weird responses when they occur and prompt the AI again to retry.\n6.

                        "answer": "The hardest part to explain simply is that this is not yet a finished stakeholder map but a structured blueprint that already holds strategic value. The most challenging question from a critic will likely be why we have not produced the full map now. The answer is that the stakeholder landscape is still evolving with the ongoing legislative process, and producing a blueprint now enables advocates to act early while the final map will be based on more complete and current data. The target audience consists of animal welfare advocates and NGO strategists who care about influencing legislation effectively and knowing who is driving the adoption of PLF. The pitch should build on their awareness of PLF\u2019s role in the animal welfare debate by showing how this early mapping gives them a head start before policy decisions are made. Doubts about the absence of influence scores or the map becoming outdated can be addressed by showing its immediate usefulness for outreach and by committing to regular updates. While the project does not directly advance my career goals, it contributes to creating a timely, evidence-based resource for those working on EU animal welfare legislation."

My target audience is animal advocates\u2014especially those engaging online, whether individually or within organizations. They care about reducing animal suffering as quickly as possible, and could be interested in a tool that can make their outreach more effective and less emotionally exhausting, ultimately reducing burnout. \n4. Many of them are already familiar with the emotional difficulty of advocacy, so I build on that shared experience rather than explaining it from scratch. I aim to use emotionally honest language and avoid coming across as critical of their passion, instead I frame the tool as something that supports and empowers their existing efforts.\n5. Some might worry that the tool will \u201cwater down\u201d their message or make them sound too soft. I\u2019d address that by emphasizing that it doesn't censor their values\u2014it helps frame them in ways that reduce defensiveness and increase the chance of actual change, which aligns with their ultimate goal of helping animals.

As artificial intelligence advances toward transformative capabilities, it creates both tremendous opportunities and risks for animals. Without deliberate inclusion of animal interests in AI development, we risk creating systems that perpetuate or even amplify this suffering. While a small but growing AI x Animals field has emerged, focusing on critical concerns like AI value alignment and the potential spread of wildlife suffering to other planets, there's a significant lack of strategic direction. Despite increasing recognition and willingness to work on these issues, the field needs clearer guidance on where to focus limited resources. We've developed a first attempt at a \"work-in-progress\" research agenda that examines the intersection of AI safety and animal welfare. Our agenda aims to identify key differences between AI Safety and AI x Animals work, explores critical decision points that determine which field might have greater impact, maps the current landscape of interventions and research, and prioritizes specific research questions to advance the field. We've reviewed the limited existing literature and mapped priority questions based on input from those interested in AI x Animals, hoping to build a helpful framework. Our tentative plan provides structure, but we recognize the need for further development to refine our research questions, provide preliminary answers where possible, develop concrete recommendations for researchers and advocates, and think of pathways for collaboration between AI Safety and animal advocacy communities. If you're interested in AI x Animals or knowledgeable about AI Safety, please review our current research agenda document by August 2nd and provide feedback on potential blind spots in our analysis, the tractability of our recommendations, and how our observations could be translated into real-world impact for animals."

Then, the preexisting work of AI x Animals, as well as how we aim to influence it, is less clearly defined, though the main factor could be that I'm not sure about any of this for now. 2. It's still hard to see how it will lead to real-world impact, and it doesn't seem completely new either (there has been some \"meta\" reflexion work on AI x Animals). I'll say that while uncertain about real-world impact, there exists a demand for a clearer idea of our priorities and possible interventions in the field, and that serious reflexion on this, including uncertainty, could raise the bar. 3. My target audience are people willing to make the future better using some of the tools of effective altruism, in particular animal-inclusive people who care about AI Safety. 4. The pitch is pretty fitted to them, but I could include more numbers, p ex on the resources in the field. 5. The doubts could be about the pertinence of pausing to reflect given how short timelines are, as well as (for a smalle rminority) cluelessness. I agree with both of these broad objections, and plan to integrate them thoroughly in the agenda, though including them in the pitch might alienate advocates who care less about that. 6. I take an active interest in AI x Animals but am not sure this is promising to reduce suffering. This will help me clear up my thoughts on this to see if I should focus on this path, as well as potentially help other advocates, which could help secure collaboration on volunteer projects in the future, for example."

While some papers have already touched on some of the animal welfare risks associated with precision-livestock farming (PLF), little attention has been paid to the risks that stem from AI enhanced PLF in particular.

But in my article for FoodFacts.org, I take a closer look at what this really means for the animals.\n\nYes, some suffering might be reduced. But AI is also making factory farming even more efficient. It allows more animals to be raised in crowded conditions with less human involvement. When animals are treated like data points on a screen, their emotional and social needs are easy to ignore. The core problem remains: these systems are still built on confinement, stress and exploitation.\n\nI wrote this piece because we need to ask bigger questions. Not just how we farm animals, but whether we should be farming them at all. AI could help us move away from cruelty, but only if we choose to use it differently. Right now, it\u2019s mostly being used to prop up a harmful system.\n\nWhat I want people to take from this article is simple: we have a choice. There are kinder, more sustainable ways to eat, and they\u2019re already available.\n\nSo here\u2019s my call to action. Visit FoodFacts.org this week. Read the article. Try one plant-based meal. Share it with someone. Every small action helps build a future where compassion, not just convenience, guides how we use technology."

                        "answer": "- What is the hardest part to explain simply?\nThat AI can reduce some animal suffering while also making the overall system more harmful. It sounds like a contradiction, but both things can be true at once.\n\n- What do you predict will be the hardest question to answer from a critic? How would you respond?\nSome might ask, \"If AI makes conditions slightly better, isn\u2019t that a good thing?\" I\u2019d say: small improvements don\u2019t fix a fundamentally cruel system. Better tools shouldn\u2019t be used to prolong suffering. They should help us move beyond it.\n\n- Who is your target audience and what do they care about?\nThe piece is aimed at regular social media and online readers, who may or may not care about animals, but may care about sustainability and the future of food.\n\n- How might your pitch need to be adapted or tailored for them?\nThey likely already know factory farming is problematic. I build on that by showing how AI might quietly reinforce it, and then offer hopeful, practical alternatives they can act on.\n\n- What difficulties or doubts might they have about your project, and how would you address these proactively?\nSome may feel overwhelmed or unsure whether individual choices matter. I try to keep the tone empowering and grounded, showing that small changes are both meaningful and doable.\n\n- How does your project advance your career goals?\nThis piece strengthens my voice as a vegan advocate focused on tech and ethics. It helps spark public dialogue, builds credibility and brings animal issues into a space where they\u2019re often overlooked."

This creates a double risk: vast digital suffering and AI systems that, as influential actors, may systematically disregard the welfare of sentient beings they create or interact with.\n\nOur Approach\nThe Digital Minds Welfare Assessment (DMWA) benchmark adapts the Animal Harm Assessment methodology to artificial consciousness. We're creating a comprehensive set of questions spanning diverse scenarios relevant to artificial welfare, evaluated across multiple dimensions critical to moral consideration. AI judge models score responses using the crafted criteria, providing quantifiable metrics for how current AI systems approach artificial consciousness and welfare.\n\nImpact\nI've created an initial set of 25 benchmark questions and adapted all evaluation dimensions and judging criteria. Next steps include scaling to hundreds of questions across diverse scenarios, refining our evaluation criteria through expert feedback, and conducting pilot evaluations on current AI models. This will establish the first empirical baseline for how AI systems consider artificial welfare.\n\nCall to Action\nI invite you to engage with this critical ethical challenge by exploring the original Animal Harm Assessment paper, and the work of organizations like Compassion in Machine Learning (CaML) and Eleos AI.\n"

Maybe whether the benchmark measures actual beliefs of the AI or if its responses will be something like role play.\n\n3. My target audience is animal welfare advocates.\n\n4. They already care about animal welfare, so I could build on that by arguing about the possibility of sentience arising in digital systems and the importance of not discriminating beings based on substrate.\n\n5. They may think that artificial sentience sounds like science fiction and that it's more important to focus on the moral problems we have right now. I'd respond by arguing that if the possibility of artificial sentience is not taken seriously now, we could be unprepared to deal with a situation of huge moral stakes given that the population of artificial beings could overshadow that of animals (both livestock and wild animals). At the same time I think working on artificial sentience may increase momentum for the animal welfare movement (as argued by Jeff Sebo) \n\n6.

By tackling misinformation at scale, I aim to promote more compassionate, informed interactions with animals.\nI built a two-part system designed to identify and respond to animal welfare misinformation online. First, I analyze Reddit posts from animal-related subreddits using keyword extraction and sentiment analysis to uncover common themes and misunderstandings. Then, I use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, grounded in peer-reviewed articles and trusted sources, to generate respectful, evidence-based replies that aim to correct misinformation in real time.\nSo far I've been able to identify clusters of keywords in key animal-related subreddits. Also using the OpenAI Responses API I've been able to augment the model with a vectorized embedding of some key scholarly articles which are used to respond to respond to misinformation. "

For instance, if you feel very strongly about the lack of transparency in supermarket chains with regards to whether or not the meat products they source were humanely slaughtered, to whom do you reach out to get this issue noticed and push for more humane regulations?\n\nThis, along with many questions about how to advocate for improving animal welfare as a citizen in The Netherlands came across my mind during the fellowship. In learning about how to contribute, I have been suggested various ways that can affect positive change for animal welfare such as donating to highly effective charities, working or volunteering for animal advocacy organisations to campaign or lobby, or working in research on alternative proteins or humane interventions for the livestock industry, just to name a few. \n\nAs I weighed these routes, I still found myself asking: \"But what about contributing to long-term changes such as changing policies that prioritise animal welfare? I live in a democratic country--shouldn't my government be doing something about this?\" I did not come across a lot of information on how to do in my network. \n\nAnd that everyone was how my project, an informative 3-part blog series about Dutch policy-making and animal welfare, came to be. Inspired by my curiosity and my belief that information on just about anything should be widely accessible, I wanted to dive into this topic with the hope that I can provide some practical and actionable insights on how to get involved in politics, as someone with zero experience and zero background. \n\nWith these blogs, I hope to inspire people living in The Netherlands to move towards action and start using our political system for change, along side all the other routes.

Meanwhile, charities, schools, and plant-based businesses committed to sustainable food systems face a different challenge: the evidence they need is scattered across outdated papers, inaccessible nutrition databases, and region-blind recommendations.\nTo address this, I\u2019m developing a concept for an AI-powered platform that transforms research and policy documents into clear, region-specific insights. The tool will help advocates and institutions create school menus, outreach programs, and policy proposals that are ethical, affordable, and culturally resonant.\nOver the past few weeks, my focus has been:\n\t\u2022 Engaging with stakeholders to identify bottlenecks in nutrition outreach\n\t\u2022 Curating research papers and government documents on protein deficiency\n\t\u2022 Mapping available data sources and surfacing accessibility challenges\n\t\nWhat\u2019s Next? I\u2019ll continue stakeholder outreach and expand dataset curation, aiming for 10\u201315 core resources. Technically, I\u2019ll begin designing the architecture for a lightweight retrieval system (MVP) using RAG-lite methodology. This includes embedding text with models like Sentence-BERT and preparing a vector store\u2014starting with one category and simple metadata. The platform will eventually support multilingual queries using Sarvam, a language model trained on Indian context and regional dialects.

This results in an inflated population of shelter dogs with significant behavioral issues that are difficult to place with capable homes, and have a subpar quality of life.\nApproach: Throughout this fellowship, I have collected resources from a wide variety of sources, from reputable career trainers, behavioral specialists, animal rights advocates, and scientists. It was the goal to use these resources to write a paper on how theories of cognition and learning can be used in synchrony with AI technology to promote accessible, effective, and personalized dog training. My final output for this session is a paper describing the issue I\u2019ve identified, and how AI-assisted tools (in particular a free \u2018Doulingo\u2019 like app) could take advantage of theories of cognition and learning to improve caretaker fluency in dog training and communication. This paper is a wide overview of my research and thoughts about this issue and the possibility of AI-assisted solutions, but as I want to continue this research in the future, it may avoid going into significant detail on some of the issues.\nImpact: I believe access to these potential AI tools would allow caretakers to take steps in understanding and training their dogs at home, reduce the number of dogs with significant preventable behavioral issues, and increase their overall quality of life. I hope that further discussion on this topic will cause others to gain interest in the topic and consider working on this issue with their own unique skill sets. \nCall to Action: I am less sure about what my specific call to action should be, but I would love any feedback."

In Southeast Asia, AI is rapidly expanding across agriculture, wildlife management, and scientific research. But there\u2019s little transparency on how it\u2019s impacting animals either positively or negatively. Some AI systems are helping: drones to detect poachers, sensors that monitor animal welfare. But others raise red flags: automated slaughter systems with no ethical oversight, or wildlife surveillance tools that could be misused. Right now, there\u2019s no centralized way to track these trends. As a result, policymakers, researchers, and advocates are flying blind. That\u2019s where Sentient Futures comes in. My project is building a public, open access website that maps the real world use of AI and its effects on animals in Southeast Asia. The platform collects case studies, visualizes risks and opportunities, and provides ethical insights for responsible development. It\u2019s inspired by projects like the Animal Rights Map and AI Safety Map but uniquely focused on our region and on animals. Over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve built a working prototype, drafted core content, and identified dozens of use cases in the region. With the right support, this can become a vital tool for journalists, NGOs, students, and decision-makers. Let\u2019s make sure AI evolves with compassion not just code."

It\u2019s also challenging to convey the importance of mapping these risks and opportunities to a non technical audience without sounding abstract.\n\nA likely tough question is: \"How will this platform actually influence real-world policy or animal welfare outcomes?\" I would respond by explaining that while the platform itself doesn\u2019t implement policy, it empowers key stakeholders like NGOs, researchers, and policymakers with curated data and ethical analysis they currently lack, enabling more informed decisions, funding, and advocacy efforts.\n\nMy primary audience includes animal advocates, journalists, ethical AI researchers, and policymakers in Southeast Asia. They care about ensuring that technological progress does not come at the cost of animal suffering and are looking for practical tools and evidence to guide humane, inclusive innovation.\n\nFor animal advocates and policymakers, the pitch should emphasize case studies, ethical guidance, and regional relevance rather than technical depth. For researchers and technologists, I might include more detail on methodology, sourcing, and how their expertise could improve the platform.\n\nSome may question the practicality of maintaining such a platform or whether enough reliable data exists. I would address this by sharing my curated initial case list, outlining a crowdsourced submission model, and noting how even partial transparency is better than the current blind spots.\n\nThis project strengthens my long term goal of working at the intersection of technology, ethics, and public impact. It showcases my ability to lead an interdisciplinary initiative, synthesize complex topics into accessible tools, and advocate for the moral inclusion of nonhuman animals in global development."

This gap limits their collective power to influence systemic change and ensure animal protection laws are robustly debated and enacted.\n\nPitch 2: For Politically Active Individuals (to highlight animal issues)\nProblem: Individuals highly engaged in political discourse and policy often overlook or are unaware of how seemingly broad issues\u2014like environmental policy, land use, or economic development\u2014directly intersect with animal welfare and conservation. This oversight can lead to policies that unintentionally harm animal populations or miss opportunities for comprehensive, animal-inclusive solutions.\n\nSolution: I am developing an automated web scraping and data aggregation workflow using n8n that identifies animal welfare issues and relevant political discussions from various online sources. This tool will provide concise, actionable summaries of political developments affecting animals, empowering advocates to engage more effectively with policymakers and legislative efforts.  The tool will provide automated scores and rankings of political candidates on animal issues.\n\nCareer Connection: My work on this project directly supports my career aspiration to bridge knowledge gaps between different advocacy sectors. By learning data automation and information extraction techniques, I am equipping myself to analyze complex policy environments and present compelling, evidence-based arguments that can integrate animal welfare considerations into broader political agendas.\n\n\n"

People will ask why they should trust an automated tool for this sort of thing.  I will have to explain that a manual process is extremely difficult and time-consuming and that the tool provides links to data sources and explains its reasoning.\n3. The target audience will be people who care about politics, animal welfare, or both.  If they care about one, I will try to convince them to care about the other.\n4. If people understand the political process, the site will be simple to understand at first glance and the pitch can be simple.  If they don't understand the process, I will either need to explain it to them or have the part of the site that explains it be very simple to understand and easy to use.\n5.

It can be used to detect diseases early on, identify when animals are hungry and respond accordingly, and better help farmers understand when farm animals experience pain, stress, or discomfort.  But AI also has the potential to significantly worsen farm animal welfare. It could make mistakes and cause great suffering as a result, decrease our empathy and concern towards farm animals, and lead to further intensification and cramped living conditions..\nOur paper seeks to address these concerns by identifying the major welfare risks associated with AI enhanced livestock farming, and providing clear, well-researched, and practical guidelines for addressing these risks.\nIn doing so, we hope to fill in several gaps in the literature. While some papers have already touched on some of the animal welfare risks associated with precision-livestock farming (PLF), little attention has been paid to the risks that stem from AI enhanced PLF in particular. Furthermore, we believe that much more can, and should, be said about what solutions will address these risks, and the practical steps that can be taken to resolve these issues.\n "

New parts to build\nOne useful feature we have not yet added is a structured tagging system for user profiles and projects. This would allow for easier discovery of researchers by topic, species focus, or technical expertise.\nTo create this, we would need to finalize a category list, implement filters on the website, and test it with a small group of users to ensure it works well.\n\n3. New areas to expand into\nSo far, the project has mostly focused on farmed animals. But the same coordination challenges exist in areas like wildlife monitoring, animal behavior research, and conservation technology.\nOne unexplored opportunity is to include individuals working on camera trap data, acoustic sensors, and other artificial intelligence tools used in conservation. These are often separate communities but could benefit from shared knowledge.\n\n4. Partners to recruit\nI intend to continue leading this project beyond the fellowship, and I am speaking with a few potential collaborators for the next phase.\nThe biggest gaps in the team are expertise in machine learning and open data management. We would also benefit from someone with nonprofit communications experience to help with outreach.\nTo find the right people, we can post in communities like Effective Altruism virtual programs, LinkedIn groups focused on artificial intelligence for good, and researcher networks in animal advocacy.\n\n5. Presentation materials to develop\nThe most compelling way to explain the project is through a visual walk-through or short demo video that shows how people can use the platform and what kind of connections it enables.\nOne piece of content we could create this month is a two minute screencast that walks through the current version of the site, with voiceover narration about who it is for and how to join."

Without engaged collaborators, it\u2019s hard to validate the hub\u2019s usefulness or impact. Small step: Host a small roundtable or webinar to gather feedback from researchers and citizen scientists interested in AI and animal welfare.\n\nNew parts to build\nA key missing feature is a searchable directory where users can find collaborators based on their focus (e.g. marine mammals, ethics, machine learning). What it would take: A low-code prototype using tools like Airtable or Notion to test user interest before building out a full backend.\n\nNew areas to expand into\nThe hub could easily grow into marine conservation\u2014particularly in areas like AI-based acoustic monitoring of cetaceans, which raises ethical concerns around surveillance and data use. Unexplored opportunity: Bring together oceanographers, ethicists, and AI researchers to explore best practices for responsible tech in marine ecosystems.\n\nPartners to recruit\nI plan to continue building the hub, however, there are considerable maintenance costs. Also we might be missing skills or mentorship. How to find them: Outreach through AI ethics communities, Wildlabs.net, conservation networks, and open calls on LinkedIn and Slack groups.\n\nPresentation materials to develop\nThe most compelling way to explain the hub is via a short explainer video that illustrates how different actors can connect and collaborate. This month\u2019s goal: Determine our image, colors and overall style. Then, publish a blog post or visual  to raise awareness and invite feedback."

Partners to recruit\nTo progress, collaboration is key. I have identified the following partners needed for the next part of the journey:\nMentor: Someone with advocacy-tech or AI-for-good experience to offer strategic guidance.\nDeveloper: A values-aligned collaborator to help build the MVP and advise on feasibility.\nFunder: A grant-giving body or ethical investor to support development and scalability.\nNext step: Tap networks, post in relevant forums, and explore tech-for-good communities.\n\n5. Presentation materials to develop\nI will produce a one-page concept summary and a short slide deck to help communicate the vision clearly. I will also include a link to my Lovable prototype to show potential.\nNext step: Share a public-facing post in LinkedIn and Slack to introduce the project, invite feedback, and connect with potential supporters."

                        "answer": "Right now, the biggest weakness is the incomplete nature of the stakeholder map \u2014 especially the lack of influence quantification and missing connections between entities. This will take up more time and since we are both working full time, it is hard to conduct such a deep dive and correct search - thus the unfinished map. \nThe project still needs a clear visualisation tool that shows relationships and influence pathways. Creating this would require structured data entry from the current blueprint and using a mapping tool like Kumu or Gephi to produce interactive visuals.\nThe continuation of this project would benefit from recruiting a policy analyst familiar with EU lobbying transparency data, a data visualisation specialist, and possibly an industry insider to validate findings. These people could be found by reaching out to relevant NGOs, academic policy research groups, and data journalism networks."

For example, adapt the primer section for educational use, and share the research synthesis with relevant labs and orgs.\n\n2. New parts to build\nMissing element:\nAn introductory section highlighting the uniqueness of this work. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly accessible synthesis of recent AI advances in wildlife communication, bridging bioacoustics, machine learning, and animal linguistics.\nWhat it would take:\nAdd a short \u201cAbout this paper\u201d section on the second page explaining its dual nature (as both a primer and a research overview) and the gap it fills.\n\n3. New areas to expand into\nGiven the current length and depth of the paper, no expansion is needed at this stage. However, it may be relevant to update the document periodically to include emerging research, new actors, or methodological breakthroughs in the field.\n\n4. Partners to recruit\nNot applicable\n\n5.

                        "answer": "Because it is not clear what could be offered from the program designers as a result of this program, I do not know how high to aim, what format to push, etc. For example, if the audience for the presentation were investors, then my format would be a pitch deck and I would demonstrate traction in the form of a small pilot, or a list of names gathered on a waiting list. I do have a vision in mind for what/how my incubator could be, but in terms of this fellowship, I notice that what I share is completely in conversation with what the judges are judging (their criteria)  and what rewards/opportunities exist at the end of the exercise. I have to be realistic about the level of effort and labor involved as a solo team member, and different \"prizes\" would yield end-results, especially when you factor in burnout. \n***\nI do think my project idea could expand to other areas. Right now I am targeting animal welfare and nonhuman animals in general with this compassionate games concept. It could focus on certain animals species (e.g. herd animals, domesticated animals, lab animals), it could center marginalized human groups (e.g. Indigenous cause areas like the return of stolen ancient Indigenous artifacts like a reverse-Indiana Jones), it could focus on digital sentience (e.g. compassionate perspectives of AI and digital mechanical life forms. \n****\nI need a gaming developer with familiarity with different developing tools and platforms, philosophies, game aesthetics, etc. to help expand the curriculum, the partnerships/sponsorships, and the pool of need experts/mentors.\n****\nI will use a long-form paper to express my idea because my deliverable essentially is me outlining the career I am creating. I could have turned it into a pitch deck, but I realized that I wouldn't actually be presenting to a group of investors, who, say, care about market data, feasibility, organization due diligence, etc. So, because my audience will be Ash and Jay, I am instead creating a text-based paper with visuals as appropriate (e.g. graphics, diagrams, and illustrative references). Perhaps having a website would aid in helping others see my idea, so I will see what I can generate with Google Script. "

Limitations to Fix\nIndia\u2019s nutrition and protein datasets are fragmented and regionally sparse, which limits the ability to generate localised, ethically framed insights for the MVP. One actionable step: Build a metadata-driven mini-repository by tagging 5\u20138 key documents based on region, intervention type, protein source, nutrients, climate cost and policy. Collaborating with GFI or PAN can enrich the dataset and validate the tagging schema.\n2. New Parts to Build\nBefore deploying a RAG-based retrieval chatbot, the project needs a foundational database and data infrastructure. What it takes: Support from domain experts, data engineers, and funding partners to design, curate, and maintain the data pipeline.\nThe framework is adaptable to other species and domains, for example, fish farming welfare in Uganda or wildlife conservation ( any particular species). Opportunity to explore: Integrating seasonal crop data with population wise affordability metrics ( cost, information and health conditions) can uncover gaps in system and help policy reforms, creating a Protein Affordability Index.\n4. Partners to Recruit\nCurrently a solo effort, with limited mentorship interaction. Missing expertise: Database architects, data engineers, ML engineers (RAG/NLP), nutritionists, and policy specialists. How to recruit: We can reach out through GFI and PAN networks, ethical AI communities, and grant-based collaborations. Funding is essential to onboard contributors effectively.\n5. Presentation materials to develop\nA compelling way to share the project would be a demo video showing practical use cases, for example, an activist in Kolkata or a nutritionist in Bundelkhand using the tool. Immediate content to create: A two-pager or slide deck that visualizes the tool\u2019s architecture, ethical framing, and regional relevance which would be ideal for stakeholder outreach or funding proposals.

There are still some big pieces to develop and the most important one is probably the sentiment analysis tool.  If I can get that to work and start bringing in a wide variety of sources, the other parts should not be as difficult.\n3. The original concept was that the results would be based on an overall score on all animal issues, but if I can get enough data, I can expand the analyses to provide scores on more specific topics (wildlife, farmed animals) and roll them into an overall score.  The model could, in theory, be expanded to one that would do similar analyses on other topics (guns, education, etc.), but I'd like animal advocates to have an advanced tool to ourselves.\n4. I don't think this project will be finished (ready to share with the public) by the end of the fellowship, but I do plan to keep working on it until it is complete.  I have a very clear vision of what i want the site to do and what I want it to look like and I'm honestly really enjoying building it and learning how to do it.  My teammate in our group has offered to continue helping, so that will be very helpful, especially if/when I get to problems I can't solve by discussing them with Gemini or ChatGPT or others.  \n5.

An article by The Guardian (2023) highlights the work of the Earth Species Project, which is using machine learning to decode animal vocalizations and behaviors. By training neural networks on massive datasets of animal sounds and interactions, researchers hope to break the barrier of interspecies communication. This could radically shift how we understand and treat nonhuman animals\u2014by granting them a \u201cvoice\u201d in conservation, welfare decisions, and habitat protection. If we can better understand how animals express pain, stress, or social needs, we can dramatically improve captive and wild animal care.

Current solutions rely on periodic human inspections, which are often infrequent, subjective, and limited in scale. As a result, millions of animals suffer in silence from untreated ailments and chronic stress.\n\nAI-powered precision livestock monitoring could change this. Using computer vision and bioacoustics, AI can continuously monitor animal behavior, posture, vocalizations, and movement to detect abnormalities that signal suffering. Unlike humans, AI can analyze thousands of animals in real-time, 24/7. This would enable rapid intervention, improve welfare standards, and hold producers accountable. Moreover, this technology could support stronger regulatory frameworks and inspire public pressure for humane practices. AI here doesn\u2019t just optimize productivity\u2014it can align industrial systems with compassion."

Most current conversations are based on assumptions or forecasts rather than direct evidence. While we know how past technologies have harmed animals, especially in factory farms, we do not yet understand how AI is already being used or what its long-term impact will be. This makes it very hard to explain the risks to the public or influence policy and ethical development.\n\nRight now, very little is being done to track or study the impact of AI on animals. Without clear data, most people do not see this as an urgent issue. That slows down action.\n\nAI itself could help by gathering and analyzing data from current systems. Where data is missing, AI could model possible outcomes and risks. This would help us bring animal welfare into mainstream AI conversations and act before harm becomes widespread."

                        "answer": "If I could solve one major animal welfare issue using AI, I would focus on improving the welfare of working animals in Nepal, especially equines like donkeys and mules that are essential to rural livelihoods but often face harsh conditions. These animals endure chronic neglect, inadequate veterinary care, and minimal monitoring. Owners, often limited by poverty, lack both awareness and resources to provide proper care. While some NGOs and local governments offer support, these efforts are often scattered, underfunded, and inconsistent, leaving big gaps in welfare. This is where AI could make a real difference. By developing a cooperative, AI-powered mobile app, we could integrate real-time veterinary data, owner-reported feedback, and environmental monitoring. This tool would not just store information but would learn from it, predicting health risks and suggesting timely interventions. Imagine a system where local vets, owners, and policymakers are connected through one platform that flags urgent welfare concerns before they become crises. What excites me most is that this shifts us from reacting to problems toward preventing them. It encourages coordinated action and creates a feedback loop that improves both animal and human well-being. Honestly, if we can make that happen, it would feel like a small but meaningful revolution in both AI and animal welfare."

Sea-lice is a big risk both to salmon welfare and to the environment around the sea-pens. Recognising this, Norwegian salmon producers are legally bound to keep track of the sea-lice levels in their pens, and must keep these levels low if they want to expand production.\nBy using tools such as the Aquabyte system, one can avoid the weekly \u201cmanual sampling\u201d: a stressful procedure which involves the fish being netted, anaesthetised and held outside the water. The automated counting is also more precise, which has further benefits, both for fish welfare (e.g., due to fewer unnecessary delousing procedures) and producer output. Regulators accept these automated counts as valid."

Two related forces may drive this: (1) fines are too small to outweigh profit motives, and (2) inspections are too infrequent because agencies are understaffed and also handle food-safety work. Serious violations usually surface only when NGOs or undercover journalists publish footage.\n\nMy proposal to tackle (2)  is mandatory overhead cameras in livestock buildings, feeding computer-vision models that watch for overcrowding, withheld feed or water, rough handling, etc. - i.e., is looking for unlawful practices in production. If the model spots an overstep, it reports to the producer and the relevant authority.\n\nAutomated, round-the-clock monitoring would raise the real risk of getting caught, making deliberate abuse and persistent neglect harder to hide. It also gives compliant farms proof for retailers and the public, which can be useful, given how damaging past expos\u00e9s have been. Face blurring and event-based storage could limit privacy risks. Obviously there are further issues here, something we can discuss in class."

Plus, a big part of the issue is a lack of understanding and empathy for what animals go through. While we have laws, shelters, and awareness campaigns, they often struggle with limited resources and changing deep-seated attitudes.\n\nThis is where AI could be a game-changer. We can imagine AI that can scan the internet for signs of cruelty, or even systems that monitor animal behaviour and sounds for distress. AI could also help investigators sort through evidence more effectively. And perhaps most powerfully, AI can help build empathy (if we intend to design it this way). For example, like the one in the \"Wild Narratives\" study, that let you hear a story from an animal's point of view. These kinds of tools can really help people connect and understand.\n\nSo, AI isn't just about better detection; it's about fostering that crucial empathy and awareness, helping us protect animals in a more proactive and effective way. Of course, we'd need to be smart and ethical about how we use it."

I imagine a tool that helps people draft localized, animal-centered micro-policies \u2014 like bird-safe building codes, non-lethal rodent control strategies, or zoning updates that support sanctuaries. While ideas like these exist, it\u2019s often difficult for activists, urban designers, or city staff to translate them into actionable proposals that work within local legal frameworks. An AI tool trained on city ordinances, environmental data, and precedent-setting policies could help bridge that gap. It would make it easier to propose small but meaningful changes tailored to local contexts. The goal is to make animals visible in urban decision-making, and to give people the tools to build cities where animals are considered part of the shared environment, not just managed as problems."

It's not working because moral suasion is very hard \u2013 especially when taking animal ethics seriously more or less requires significant behaviour change (going vegan), when animals cannot advocate for themselves and are lacking in legal and political power, and when industries that exploit and harm animals are incentivised to preserve themselves, consolidate their own power and maximise shareholder profit before they reduce animal suffering.\n\n3. If AI becomes superintelligent relative to humans, it could demonstrate that intelligence and sentience (and thus moral value) are orthogonal. \"If we don't want ASI to do to us what we do to nonhumans, we should stop doing what we do to nonhumans\" is a pretty powerful argument. (To be clear, I don't want to be invasively experimented on by ASI, and I don't want humans to be either. I want no one to be invasively experimented on, regardless of species or substrate.)"

In terms of what is currently done, there are many grassroots orgs (like the Humane League) that rely heavily on volunteers to run their corporate campaigns and pressure companies to go cage-free. However, I think this could be done more efficiently with AI. Firstly, grassroots orgs could leverage AI more to do research on targets, pull in weakpoints, and use those to their advantage to start campaigns. In addition, volunteers could use AI - like voice agents - to automatically call and pressure targets to go cage-free. These are just a couple examples of what could be done."

Current algorithms still output similar images with the same prompts from years ago which shows a lack of progress in the perception of animals other than to human utility. AI being able to account animal conditions can lead to better reporting of unethical practices and reduce overproduction which can ease animal suffering."

                        "answer": "One issue I\u2019d prioritize solving with AI is animal experimentation in biomedical research and drug testing. Despite growing awareness, millions of animals are still used annually, even though over 90% of drugs that pass animal tests fail in human trials. This stems from systemic biological differences, ethical complacency, and inertia within regulatory systems. While alternatives like organ-on-chip models and computational simulations exist, they remain underutilized due to lack of awareness, validation pathways, and integration across research pipelines.\n\nAI could accelerate this transition by improving predictive modelling of human responses, optimizing organ-on-chip simulations, and identifying when animal data misaligns with human biology. It could also map redundant experiments, aid regulators in assessing risk, and support open-source platforms for data transparency. Crucially, AI can expose the inefficiencies and moral costs of animal testing in ways that are scientifically rigorous and policy relevant. This would then catalyze a shift toward humane, human-relevant science."

Some papers have established protocols and methods, but their approach hasn't been open source and may not be fully comprehensive.  LLM models have been slowly taking over more and more aspects of societal functioning, hence their level of species bias is very important to analyse.\n\nAnother area I would like to work on is establishing effective wild animal welfare interventions. The field of wild animal welfare is just emerging, hence there is still a lot of ground to cover in terms of research. AI allows a level of tracking the social encounters of the animals that hasn't been possible before. As someone who studied Networked and Social Systems Engineering, I think the analysis of the social network structures of wild animals has been understudied. "

Most people do not regularly encounter vegan messages and are consequently not influenced by them. Current efforts include documentaries, in-person outreach, social media and organic social interactions. All of these are bottlenecked by a paucity of funding and people willing to unabashedly promote veganism. AI could auto-generate a lot of text to flood the internet. Animal exploitation industries will do the same thing, so we likely will still face a disadvantage due to having less funding with which to buy LLM subscriptions / compute.

Currently there are attempts to monitor affective states e.g. via facial expressions but it is hard to do this due to the lack of gold standards (such as verbal self reports in humans). To assess animal wants preference tests and motivational tests are used but these only work in experimental settings and we know little about how all this is influenced by e.g. prior experiences of animals. AI could help in scaling up observations (video) of animals in several different settings where we have a good reason to assume positive/negative affective states and then come up with suggestions for potential indicator variables using also knowledge from neurology, physiology etc. AI could also help assess behavior in enriched environments over long time periods to better understand animal wants."

Companies like IBM (https://sentientmedia.org/ai-model-spare-animals-lab-testing/), Procter&amp;Gamble (https://www.politico.eu/sponsored-content/ending-animal-testing-for-good/) and Smarter Sorting (https://www.fastcompany.com/90732281/meet-the-animal-testing-alternative-that-could-prevent-unnecessary-deaths)  are working on alternatives based on the use of AI. However,  despite scientific advancements, legislative barriers persist. In many countries\u2014such as under the EU\u2019s chemical regulation REACH\u2014chemical safety and registration laws are still based on outdated scientific approaches. These frameworks often require proof of adverse effects in animals to assess ingredient safety, rather than embracing the full potential of New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) that offer more sophisticated and human-relevant predictions of safety risks.\n\n2. AI is good at analysing a large amount of data. As one of the above articles mentions: \"extensive training will be needed to enable a \u201cparadigm\u201d shift away from focusing on a substance\u2019s adverse effects in animals, toward methods that focus on \u201cmodes of action\u201d which are more relevant for assessing human safety.\" Thus a series of changes are needed at different levels such as: \n- Development of AI models to predict effects in humans\n- Changes in legal frameworks\n- Training to change the paradigm "

Researchers have found their clicks might work a bit like a phonetic alphabet \u2014 possibly structured communication.  I was aware of their naming protocols,  but I didn't realise we were getting such deep undertanding of their 'conversations'. \n\nWhat\u2019s exciting is that AI lets us work with massive amounts of animal sound data in ways we never could before. It\u2019s a bit like how telescopes opened up space \u2014 AI is giving us new tools to \"hear\" and interpret the animal world. Though Aza Raskin talked about needing to look to the ocean before we look to space....\n\nThere\u2019s also a beautiful link to the past \u2014 in the 1970s, people heard whale songs for the first time and it sparked a huge conservation movement. Maybe understanding animal communication could be the emotional hook we need today to boost animal protection.  BUT - what is the shadow side? \n\nThe article also touched on how this research might support legal and ethical changes \u2014 like giving animals more rights or protections. For example, if we can show that whales have culture or complex social structures, it could help push for stronger protections, especially around noise pollution.  BUT - we don't do this for many human cohorts, what will make it different for other species? \n\nThere's a real risk of this technology being misused. The article warns about surveillance or exploiting animals in ways we haven\u2019t thought through yet. So it\u2019s important we develop strong ethical guidelines as we go.\n\nI also loved the point that this kind of work could align with Indigenous knowledge. Many Indigenous cultures already understand animals as having their own agency and ways of communicating. AI might finally be catching up with that perspective.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a call for caution \u2014 using principles like \u201cdo no harm,\u201d and making sure animal welfare is the priority. Just because we can use AI to study them doesn\u2019t mean we should do it in any way that\u2019s invasive or disrespectful.\n\n"

This is a huge \u201cwicked\u201d problem so I will narrow down the focus to species like honey bees and bumblebees, which have more than 20,000 species. Pollinators like bees contribute directly to food security and biodiversity, with a third of global food production dependent on bees. Bee populations have been declining globally due to habitat loss, intensive farming practices, climate change and pesticides. \n\nSome efforts to address the problem include:\n* Bans on harmful pesticides (e.g., EU-wide ban in 2018)\n* Habitat restoration projects such as wildflower corridors, and improved hive management practices \n* Public Awareness Campaign like the Bee Day from FAO\n\nWhy it isn\u2019t enough: Climate change continues to outpace restoration, while pesticide regulation faces resistance from powerful agricultural lobbies. Many conservation strategies lack real-time monitoring and scalability, making it difficult to address the wicked problem with interlinked drivers.\n\nAI is being used for beekeeping: sensors detecting infestation or any unusual activity, the system can automatically feed and water the bees, treat pests and even change temperature and humidity. The startup BeeOdiveristy uses AI to measure pollutants and state of biodiversity using the data bees gather. The World Bee Project Hive Network uses AI algorithms to look for patterns of the beehives so conservationists can better protect them. While it can't replace ecological action or political will, AI can enhance the scale, precision, and effectiveness of current efforts, especially in providing timely data and supporting data-driven policy decisions. \n"

Chicken are often tied upside down or crammed onto rooftops of public transport vehicles, methods that cause extreme stress, injury and even death. While Kenya has policies regulating animal transport, enforcement is weak due to limited resources and low interest in animal welfare.\nAI could revolutionize this space through automated enforcement. Traffic and roadside surveillance cameras could be enhanced with AI-powered image recognition to detect vehicles transporting chicken in prohibited ways. Once detected, the system could automatically capture vehicle number plates and relay alerts to relevant authorities for action. This would increase enforcement efficiency, create accountability and act as a deterrent. Using AI for monitoring would make it possible to scale enforcement efforts, reduce suffering for millions of chickens and strengthen compliance with existing welfare laws."

I think AI could be used to create greater empathy for other species. Generative AI incorporating large amounts of data can help us to see their perspectives, and AI can be used to decode the communication of other species, allowing us to better understand each other.\n\nWhile some writers and artists do strive to represent the perspectives of nonhuman animals, it is often dismissed as pure fiction \u2014 especially since it is much harder to incorporate our full range of knowledge of other species, so it is no nearly as accurate. Human-made art is important for reaching people emotionally, but I think AI would do a better job of helping people to understand the perspectives and considerations of other species without human bias.\n\nWhile it would theoretically be possible to decode nonhuman animals\u2019 communication without AI, it would be much more challenging given the vast quantities of data and, again, human biases in interpreting those data. AI makes this field of study much more feasible. Voice synthesis technologies could also be adapted to allow us to communicate with other species in their own languages, which would be more difficult and likely less precise otherwise."

My goal is to create alternatives that outperform conventional animal products on every front, until raising animals for food becomes obsolete. While many companies have launched alt protein products in recent years, they have yet to convince mainstream consumers to make major changes to their diets.\n\nI believe AI can help alternative proteins take major steps forward.

Interventions to tackle speciesism tend to focus on appealing to the audience's logic or emotions to induce some sort of change in their moral behavior. However, as predicted by Terror Management Theory, it is possible that speciesism is a type of defense strategy employed by humans to fuel their sense of importance and the meaning of their lives. Attempting to break this strategy by directly opposing it may fuel completely opposite behaviors for strengthening it even more. The underlying cause is a feeling of meaningless of human life that is associated with humans' capacity to envision their future death. (I haven't had time to review the literature on that extensively, but this is indeed based on my past readings in existential psychology).\n3. If AI is to do better in helping us tackling speciesism, based on the argument above, it will need to help us better understand and mitigating this phenomenon of humans' implicitly using speciesism as a defense strategy for meaningless, death-bound lives. There are several intervention paths that could use AI, such as using AI to shed more light into the psychological mechanisms underpinning Terror Management Theory and its relation to worldviews and speciesism, or using AI to help humans create meaningful lives through mutually beneficial interactions with animals. A more bold use could be the employment of AI to the scientific search for extraterrestrial life in astronomy and planetary science, since a potential discovery of life beyond Earth might induce an overall paradigm shift in worldviews that encompass the superiority of humans over animals as a shield against meaningless lives, which could in turn render speciesism an obsolete defense strategy."

Despite intellectual recognition of animal sentience, most people's actions don't align with their values regarding animal suffering.\n\nCurrent advocacy approaches primarily reach the already-converted through emotional appeals or ethical arguments. These methods struggle to bridge the gap between knowledge and behavior change at scale.\n\nAI could revolutionize this through personalized ethical development systems that identify individual psychological barriers to moral consideration. By analyzing digital behavior patterns, AI could detect a person's existing values and show how they logically extend to excluded animals. The system would deliver tailored information at psychologically optimal moments, presenting content matched to each person's unique cognitive and emotional profile. This personalized approach could systematically reduce the disconnect between moral recognition and ethical action, gradually expanding our collective circle of concern."

There's currently several angles of attack-- improved conditions (space, cleaning, outdoors access), humane slaughter, legal rights, and more--but I think AI could approach an inherent issue that these don't address (other than abolitionist approaches like alternative proteins). Chickens are bred to grow so quickly that their legs can't support their weight, so their short lives are spent in constant pain. In a welfarism approach, AI could help guide precision breeding/genetic editing to create chickens that could grow as quickly as factory farming demands but with a physical body that can support this growth with less pain. Although it wouldn't address the root cause of chicken suffering (consumer demand), it could help reduce the magnitude of suffering chickens face."

                        "answer": "One major animal welfare issue I would like to solve using AI is the harm and suffering caused in factory farming - particularly that of laying hens, who represent the largest group of land vertebrates exploited for mass consumption. \nThe problem:\nBillions of laying hens are confined in industrial systems under unethical conditions to meet the global demand for eggs. Despite increasing awareness and the general public recognizing the practice as \"inhumane\", egg consumption remains high worldwide.\nWhat is currently being done:\nCompanies like Just Egg have developed plant-based alternatives that mimic the taste and texture of eggs surprisingly well. While promising, these products remain rather expensive, less accessible, and are often perceived as synthetic or niche. As a result, they primarily appeal to higher-income consumers or those already committed to plant-based diets or to a higher consumption of plant-based products. Mass adoption of such products is rather limited and conventional egg consumption continues to dominate - especially in markets where affordability and familiarity are key factors. \nHow AI could help:\nAI can be used to accelerate the development of better, cheaper, and more appealing plant-based egg alternatives by designing and optimizing plant-based proteins that replicate the functional properties of eggs more closely; engineering crops to produce these proteins more efficiently and at a lower cost; analyzing consumer preferences to inform development that resonates with mainstream audiences (taste, texture, form, and price-point).\nBy making alternative products more affordable, accessible, and indistinguishable from animal-based eggs, AI could play a pivotal role in reducing global egg consumption, and thus dramatically decreasing the suffering of hens in factory farms.

At the moment, assessments often focus on physical health or productivity, which don\u2019t tell us much about how animals are actually feeling. We miss subtle behaviours or patterns that might reflect stress, comfort or other emotional states, especially across different species or settings. There\u2019s also a lot of variation in how welfare is measured, which makes it hard to compare or improve conditions consistently.\n\nAI could help by analysing video, sound and other data to spot patterns that humans might overlook. It could highlight changes in behaviour or physiology that suggest animals are thriving or struggling, and do so in a way that\u2019s tailored to the species and environment. With better indicators, we could make welfare assessments more reliable, more responsive and more focused on what matters most to the animals themselves.\n\nMy hope is that this would also help us be more strategic about where we put our efforts, whether through direct interventions, policy changes, or developing alternatives like new protein sources, so that we can achieve the greatest welfare improvements overall."

These population dynamics can be relevant to those who believe, like many advocates do, that since most wild animals live short lives containing intense suffering, it might be preferrable that less of them come to be, and that this is an effective intervention to help animals (in the same way reducing the amount of farmed animals is considered good by those who care about farmed animals). However, few people are interested on this, and massive research would be needed to get beyond the borderline speculative estimates that dominate in these fields (mainly coming form a few Brian Tomasik articles).  AI can be well-suited to dealing with very large amounts of data and finding patterns, which could help for analyzing existing ecosystems (and other areas, like crops) and get an estimate of the number of animals of different species living on them, as tracking, especially for small animals, can still be difficult. Future AIs might be better suited to this sort of work where identifyind patterns matters a lot. This could then be less costly, and especially less time-consuming, and thus, even with few humans interested in the subject, solid research might be produced in the future, and incline advocates to get potentially robust ideas of how to reduce the suffering of wild animals."

However, cheaper plants could also lead to cheaper factory farmed animal products. \n- Industrial plant agriculture currently causes a lot of wild animal suffering (e.g. due to pesticides, getting run over by combine harvesters, etc). AI in crop agriculture can reduce this suffering directly (e.g. via more precise pesticide usage), or indirectly (e.g. via reducing costs of agricultural methods which do not cause wild animal suffering, e.g. vertical farms).

Many things are being done to try to address animal suffering on factory farms, either directly (e.g. using bigger cages), or indirectly (e.g. reducing demand for factory farmed animal products by creating meat alternatives). However, welfare improvements on factory farms have been minimal in many areas, and demand for factory farmed animal products is still high. AI can address these problems, both directly and indirectly. Precision livestock farming, with the assistance of AI, can be used to improve animal welfare on such farms, e.g. by detecting hunger cues quickly and feeding animals as soon as they need it. AI can also assist in the development of meat alternatives that can in turn reduce demand for factory farmed animal products. "

Could we monitor animal suffering globally with the assistance of AI in order to best mitigate it, and to prove it to those who doubt they can suffer?\n2.  There have been efforts to quantify suffering by looking at things like nociceptor density, or methodologies like the one used by Rethink Priorities to put some numbers down on factory farm suffering. These are good first steps, but they are not empirical and objective enough for my taste. There's a hard limit to what we can measure about subjective experience, sure, but a robust understanding of how subjective human suffering links to objective neural correlates could at least strongly imply the existence of this suffering when the same neural correlates are identified in animals, assuming physicalism. \n3. I think AI has the capacity to identify patterns that humans cannot in large datasets. Need to develop this idea a little more, but if there are objectively measurable things that can be used as indicators or predictors of suffering, I think AI can find them more readily, especially when dealing with multiple indicators in a high-dimensional possibility space where human intuitions will start to break down. \n"

Essentially swapping conventional meat and animal products with plant-based alternatives.\n2. There is great investment by the private sector into R&amp;D for the development of alternative proteins such as NotCo and Impossible Foods. However, few governments are taking lead in regulating the alternative proteins industry, though the government of Singapore has already started.\nAnother challenge is that plant-based alternatives don\u2019t taste or mimic the texture of \u201cconventional meats\u201d. Ever taken a bite out of a mushroom burger? It may smell and look like a regular burger we eat at our favourite fast-food joint but one bite gives it all away. The taste and texture of meat is so ingrained in us that an alternative that looks and smells like one is just insufficient to satisfy our expectations. This is what companies like Impossible Foods are trying to solve.\n3. AI could help food scientists come up with novel ways to better mimic non-plant-based ingredients be it texture- or taste-wise, hence accelerating the adoption for plant-based alternatives by the general public.\nAI could also help scientists to accelerate research as AI systems can run trials at a much faster pace and reduce the amount of paperwork needed to be carried for procurement of raw materials.

This work remains highly valuable and can play an instrumental role in advancing animal welfare in developing nations. Unfortunately, much of this research has been buried in archives, making it inaccessible, especially to those in low-resource settings who could benefit from it the most. With the rise of artificial intelligence, there is now an opportunity to retrieve and organise this knowledge, making it globally accessible. AI can bridge this gap by uncovering and connecting past studies to current challenges, empowering researchers in developing countries to move beyond foundational research and focus on interventional studies, backed by robust, existing evidence. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted a research project on animal welfare. I struggled to find related literature to support my work at the time. Ironically, after completing the project, I stumbled upon advanced studies that had already explored, and in some cases, fully addressed, the questions I had investigated. AI has the potential to prevent such disconnects by ensuring that valuable research is not lost, but rather made visible and useful to all. Bridging this gap will lead to more data-driven, evidence-based solutions that can significantly improve the quality of life for animals. Additionally, increased access to existing research may reduce the need for new experimental studies involving animals, as researchers can build on already available data rather than starting from scratch."

                        "answer": "Research has consistently shown that farmers are willing to maintain good welfare conditions for their animals, consumers prefer to buy products from animals raised in humane conditions, and governments actively promote animal welfare as part of sustainable livestock practices. In response, various studies have led to the development of animal welfare assessment tools. However, these tools are often designed with researchers and scientists in mind, making them too technical and impractical for everyday use by farmers or individuals without a scientific background. As a result, while we encourage farmers to uphold animal welfare standards, they are left without accessible tools to evaluate or improve their own practices. Similarly, consumers who care about the welfare of animals behind the products they buy have no simple, reliable way to assess or verify those conditions. This disconnect between intention and accessibility creates a significant barrier to widespread adoption and accountability in animal welfare practices. Despite advances in animal welfare tools, like AI monitoring systems, wearable sensors, and mobile apps, most remain inaccessible to smallholder farmers and everyday consumers, especially in developing regions. Challenges include high costs, low digital literacy, scientific complexity, poor localisation, weak policy support, and lack of awareness. While these tools can assess and improve animal welfare, they often cater to large commercial farms in developed countries. As a result, farmers lack practical means to evaluate welfare on their farms, and consumers struggle to verify welfare claims. AI can improve animal welfare by making assessment tools more accessible, especially in developing regions. It can simplify complex science into local languages, offer voice-based support for low-literacy users, and provide offline, low-cost tools tailored to smallholder farmers. AI can also deliver predictive alerts to prevent welfare issues, generate consumer-friendly welfare scores, and adapt over time through continuous learning. Unlike static tools, AI can personalize and scale solutions, helping farmers understand and improve animal care, and enabling consumers to make informed choices."

                        "answer": " think all different sections are connected in the way that we \"see\" animals in perspective to us. I would want to change current farming practices but the resistance comes from how ingrained and large , from an economic perspective current practices are in the foundation of our society. So I would want to start with what can be the first domino/ step in this process : Problem: Changing the Way We Treat Pets : Pets are often misunderstood when it comes to their emotional and behavioral needs. Traditional pet care and training often rely on outdated methods or human assumptions about what animals need. Changing the fact that pets are considered property, abandoned, neglected and abused without repercussions is a first step. What is Currently Being Done: Behavioral Understanding: AI-based pet trackers, such as PetPace, monitor pets' behavior and emotional states through vital signs. AI tools like CleverPet adapt to pets' learning progress, offering behavior-based training. Most AI tools for tracking animal behavior are commercial, species-limited, and lack scientific rigor, leaving huge gaps in emotional accuracy and accessibility. Animal Protection Laws: France (2021) and New Zealand (2022) introduced laws recognizing animals as sentient beings. The UK also updated its animal welfare laws to improve protections for pets and farm animals. Punishments for Abuse/Neglect: Canada (Bill C-84, 2021) and California (AB 1288) introduced stricter penalties for animal abuse, with sentences of up to three years for offenders. Animals are still treated as property and legal protections often exclude non-companion or less \u201ccharismatic\u201d species. Weak enforcement, low reporting rates, and lack of tech-based detection mean abuse frequently goes unpunished. How AI could do it better : AI research is helping decode animal emotions and accelerate research into animal consciousness, brain activity, and emotional complexity. This can help shift moral consideration through evidence-based legislation by quantifying sentience and suffering across species through standardized Sentience Impact Assessments. AI can identify signs of abuse, neglect, or abandonment and flag them for enforcement or welfare intervention. "

                        "answer": "Re: 'Speciesist algorithmic bias'\n\nMost online writing talks about animals as things we eat, wear, or experiment on as opposed to living beings that feel pain and joy. When AI systems learn from this one-sided material, they pick up the idea that animals don\u2019t really matter except for human use. That hidden bias (speciesism) could lead future, more powerful AIs to keep supporting factory farms or overlook wild-animal suffering on a massive scale.\n\nThe fix is simple but urgent. We need to add more stories, facts, and descriptions that put animals at the centre, showing their viewpoints and welfare needs. By feeding AIs with balanced data (for example, using everyday words like \u201cchicken\u201d or \u201cbeef\u201d to ideas about well-being) we can teach them to value all sentient life.  Acting now could keep future AI from hard-wiring these harmful attitudes."

In the meantime, leaders can brag about \u201cprogress\u201d while cruel practices continue happening. I think it'd be incredibly helpful to have a public website that uses AI to:\n\n- constantly read reports, contracts, and news in many languages;\n- pull out the exact promises and any numbers showing progress;\n- cross-check those claims with fresh satellite or drone photos and basic sensor data from farms;\n- turn it all into simple scores that anyone from campaigners to investors can see.\n\nAlways-updated, automatic tracking would shine a light on broken promises and put real pressure on decision-makers to treat animals better."

She cites experiments that help dogs screen and detect \"the odor of cancer on patient\u2019s breaths\" and AI's ability to increase the accuracy and sensitivity; that it successfully detected four types of cancer (breast, lung, colorectal and prostate) in 94% of cases, based on a November 2024 study. She highlights AI's role in helping to identify service and guide dog candidates, and cites a project where an AI model \"achieved 80% prediction accuracy over a 12-month period\" and spotted signs of suitability based on behavioral pattern detection and mapping of dog personalities. She cites a report where AI is being used to better understand dog barks and notes that this model may have positive implications for animal welfare. She includes the possibilities of giving AI \"vast amounts of data, including video, audio and sensor input\" and how this may improve dog training."

They looked miserable. I tried to google to learn more about that farm, that site, and what news articles or forum posts had to say about the conditions, and beyond Google Reviews for that mapped location, I could not find anything substantial. This is what I would like to change. I am not sure if drone technology is answer, but I AI allows me to ponder what types of data when integrated can give everyday consumers like me access and insight on the specific conditions farmed animals are experiencing.

While there are efforts to license and regulate breeders and campaigns that encourage adoption over buying, these approaches aren\u2019t working well. Enforcement takes time, money, and personnel, and many unethical breeders operate under the radar. At the same time, public awareness is limited, and people are still heavily influenced by social media trends and misleading ads. AI could help in two significant ways: First, by scanning online platforms to identify unlicensed or suspicious breeding activity using pattern recognition, image analysis, and language cues. Second, by subtly shifting public perception through algorithmic intervention\u2014redirecting search traffic, creating targeted educational content, and promoting ethical alternatives when people begin looking for a pet. With AI, we can both reduce supply and reshape demand. (Written by me but edited by chatgpt)"

Fragmentation isolates animal populations, reducing genetic diversity and limiting access to essential resources. Roads also disrupt crucial migration routes, impacting breeding and survival. Current mitigation efforts like wildlife crossings and fencing often fall short due to insufficient placement, cost, and the sheer scale of road networks. AI offers potential solutions by enabling more precise placement of crossings based on animal movement data, dynamic warning systems for drivers, and proactive identification of high-risk areas to inform infrastructure planning and conservation efforts."

Instead of relying only on farmers to manually check each animal, which takes time and isn\u2019t always accurate; PLF systems watch over the animals 24/7. They can track how much an animal eats, drinks, sleeps, moves, and even detect early signs of stress or sickness. This makes it easier to act fast before things get worse. Dilepix, uses AI to analyze camera footage in real time to spot things like lameness in cows or tail-biting in pigs; two major signs that animals are uncomfortable or in pain. PLF can really help improve animal welfare by making sure each animal gets the care it needs on time. It also helps reduce the use of antibiotics and makes farming more sustainable. So it\u2019s a win for both the animals and the farmers."

Investigations in slaughterhouses across various countries have revealed animals being mishandled, stunned improperly, or killed while still conscious: violating ethical standards and causing severe suffering. While some facilities are monitored through limited CCTV, audits, or whistleblower reports, these methods are often reactive, inconsistent, or compromised by lack of enforcement.\n\nAI could revolutionize this by providing real-time video monitoring using computer vision systems to detect stress behaviours, improper handling, or non-compliance with slaughter protocols. Machine learning models could flag violations instantly, allowing faster intervention and accountability. Unlike human inspections, AI could operate 24/7, remain objective, and scale globally. This would not only protect animals but also help facilities meet welfare standards more reliably, building a system that prioritizes humane treatment from slaughter to plate."

There are several NGOs working on issues related to the welfare of wildlife affected by tourism activities, participating in advocacy movements, tourism awareness, legislative changes, humanitarian alternatives, etc. However, there is little use of technological tools to positively impact this activity, both to minimise stressful experiences for animals and to enrich the experience and support learning about the needs of animals. AI is currently used to monitor certain species, recognise animal communication mechanisms, analyse negative impacts on the environment, etc., but there are few efforts specifically focused on tourism and wildlife. Work could be done on technology to help determine the carrying capacity of sites, study the response of wildlife to visitors, and enrich the experience without relying solely on direct observation of animals."

While some may argue otherwise, the reality is: animals can be really good at hiding or not expressing their pain because they are literally wired to not show weakness for fear of being snapped up predators. There are so many stories of pet owners with no clue that their pet was in chronic pain, or slowly dying of an illness. \n- Once more accurate technologies are put in place, it could lead to animal suffering to be taken more seriously (as some people still understand animal pain/suffering to be minor in comparison to human suffering)\n- But whether these technologies will be 100% accurate at detecting expressions is still a work in progress, and requires quite a bit of guess work. Who's to say that every facial expression is an honest reflection of how the animal is feeling. In fact, what if animals start to train themselves to start expressing certain facial expressions because (e.g. more pain even if not in pain) because it rewards them with more food, time, or care? \n\nIn reflecting on this piece, while I agree that more accurate readings can lead to more targeted care (esp. when they are sick or in pain), I think investing huge amounts of resources into such technological applications, especially towards livestock, should not be the highest priority as it can lead to a normalisation of the idea that eating animals is something we should keep on doing, so long as they've had a good life/were well-taken cared of.

I imagine many pet owners want the same, but because of how life is, with all its responsibilities and commitments, and a general lack of knowledge, people aren't able to dedicate large swathes of time towards monitoring their pets in a comprehensive and accurate way. This can lead to premature death, huge medical builds, and emotional distress for everyone involved. \n\nCurrently there are some AI-powered health monitoring apps such as TTcare that scans eyes and skin to detect signs of illness. I would say that the app is only as effective as the pet owner's ability i.e., having a basic understanding of what is considered normal and abnormal, and whether they are generally an observant person. Technology can be helpful solutions, but their longevity and support requires a cultural shift i.e., we need not just to care about animal pain/suffering, but care about their preventative health and to care about being responsible pet owners (which is a spectrum in what than means rather than an absolute ideal).

It's titled \"AI data gaps might result in continuous animal suffering.\" It relates to speciesist algorithmic bias. Essentially, human-data driven AI datasets ensure that AI outcomes and endeavors favor humans over animals after decades of compiling data without regard to nonhuman animal interests. For instance, AI enhances tilapia and catfish farming at Kiryabishoro Aqua Park in Uganda's Ibanda District, but without a dataset assessing fish sentience, the findings may lead to increased stocking densities for Nile tilapia and African catfish, which contributes to the stress and disease of the 150,000 tons of aquaculture production for which these fish are most predominant in Uganda.\n\nSuch a bias can compound injury as more fish farms are created to support the needs of production. Yet technological solutions exist, such as welfare oriented AI datasets, which allow researchers to implement ethical conditions to reduce suffering. I will use this to argue how AI increases or decreases animal suffering in the fish farm industry, depending on whether it's constructed with intention.\n"

Without this data, legislation risks remaining vague, difficult to enforce, or misaligned with actual animal welfare needs.\nCurrent gap: Despite broad agreement on improving welfare during transport, EU legislation often relies on general assumptions rather than concrete animal-based evidence. At the same time, industry stakeholders lack the tools to assess welfare conditions during transport and to ensure compliance with future legal requirements.\nAI solution: Artificial Intelligence can process real-time data from transport vehicles, such as temperature, humidity, and movement, together with animal-based indicators,  like vocalisations or respiratory patterns, to detect early signs of stress. This technology can identify the exact conditions under which animals begin to suffer, turning observation into actionable thresholds. The resulting evidence base would allow policymakers to define clear, enforceable rules, while offering transport operators and competent authorities the ability to implement the law effectively and proactively protect animal welfare."

Today, billions of animals live in intensive farming conditions where their physical and emotional well being is difficult to monitor at scale. Current solutions rely on occasional human inspections, which are limited, subjective, and reactive rather than preventive. As a result, signs of illness, distress, or abuse often go unnoticed.\nAI could revolutionize this by using computer vision and sound analysis in real time to monitor animals continuously, identifying early signs of pain, lameness, overcrowding, or abnormal behavior. Machine learning algorithms could alert farm workers or veterinarians instantly, enabling faster intervention. Moreover, AI could aggregate welfare data across farms to pressure industry change and inform policymaking. This proactive, scalable approach could shift the industry from neglect to accountability creating measurable improvements in the lives of animals currently hidden from view."

The key to transition will likely be the profit motive.

                        "answer": "How to Measure Welfare?\nAnimal welfare is a broad and complex concept, involving physical health, mental well-being, natural behaviors, and environmental conditions. Frameworks like the Five Freedoms and Five Domains emphasize these multiple dimensions. Welfare measurement ideally includes both direct indicators\u2014such as injuries, illness, body condition\u2014and indirect indicators like behavior patterns, stress hormone levels, and quality of the animal\u2019s environment.\nPrecision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies use automated sensors to collect proxy measures such as activity levels, feeding frequency, body temperature, or heart rate. These proxies are assumed to correlate with welfare states, allowing continuous and large-scale monitoring that would be difficult for humans alone. However, the challenge lies in ensuring that these proxy measures genuinely reflect the comprehensive welfare of the animals, including both physical and psychological aspects.\n\nRisks of a Gap Between Welfare and Proxy Measures in PLF:\nIf a gap exists between the actual welfare of animals and the proxy measures tracked by PLF systems, several risks emerge:\nMisleading Assessments: Proxy data may fail to detect certain welfare issues. For example, an animal may appear physically healthy by sensor data but suffer from stress, pain, or social deprivation that is not captured by the technology. This could delay crucial interventions, worsening animal suffering.\nNeglect of Welfare Dimensions: PLF systems often focus on measurable parameters but may overlook psychological wellbeing or social behaviors that are vital for overall welfare. This narrow focus risks incomplete welfare assessment.\nOverreliance on Technology: Farmers might depend heavily on PLF data and reduce direct observation, potentially missing subtle or early signs of distress that require human judgment.\nInappropriate Management Decisions: Decisions based solely on proxy data may not address all welfare needs, leading to insufficient care or inappropriate environmental conditions.\nEthical and Trust Issues: If welfare claims based on proxy data are unsubstantiated, this can undermine consumer, regulator, and advocate trust in PLF technology."

Technological risk: If precision livestock systems increase the profitability and growth of factory farms, they could make it harder to shut them down in the future.\n\nArguments for focusing on regulating precision livestock systems\n1. More realistic influence: These systems are being developed and adopted right now, which gives us a real chance to guide how they are used.\n2. More likely to succeed: There is already interest in artificial intelligence regulation among researchers and policymakers who may care about animal welfare.\n3. Preventing expansion of suffering: Without proper rules, precision systems may lead to many more animals being raised in poor conditions while appearing modern and efficient.\n\nMy view: Focus on regulating precision livestock systems while still supporting abolition\nI believe working to regulate these systems is the more impactful and achievable path at this point in time because:\n1. We have an opportunity to influence this technology before it becomes widespread and difficult to reverse.\n2. Even if abolition is the long-term goal, many animals will suffer in the coming years if these systems expand without limits.\n3.

It goes beyond survival to include how the animal feels and functions.\n\nPLF tends to track easily measurable, physical data such as:\n1. Body temperature\n2. Movement patterns (e.g. walking, lying down)\n3. Feeding and drinking frequency\n4. Vocalizations\n5. Growth rates\n6. Respiration or heart rate\n\nThese are proxies, indirect indicators of welfare, not welfare itself.\n\nAssociated Risks:\nFirst, farms may appear to meet welfare standards while animals continue to suffer in ways the technology cannot detect, such as from social isolation, or chronic stress. Second, complex emotional and behavioral needs may be ignored in favor of simple and measurable data like weight gain or movement. Third, welfare may be reduced to a narrow set of metrics, leading to surface-level improvements that do not enhance overall well-being. This could result in misleading reporting, regulatory complacency, and misplaced public trust in animal welfare claims. Ultimately, without careful validation, PLF may mask suffering rather than reduce it."

If those goals ignore affective states like curiosity, contentment, or social fulfillment, then suffering could quietly intensify. Worse, AI might reinforce harmful norms by learning that the average condition is \"good enough,\" even when the average is bleak. To reduce these risks, we need AI tools to track more than the basics. Systems should include behavioral diversity, emotional expression, and longitudinal changes in individuals.

We have seen that it is possible for entire countries and regions to lose power for hours or days at the time. So what would happen when this occurs and the care-givers do not know how to handle their animals properly? It could lead to animal disconfort or even harm. Additionally, from an ethical POV, this decrease of empathy from the human to the animals raises concerns on the overall wellness of the animals. \n\nTractability: As it says in the article, this is hard to track.

While the complete abolition of factory farming remains a distant goal, AI presents a unique opportunity to improve the quality of life for animals in these systems concurrently with ongoing efforts towards abolition. Supporting this, I consider the following:\n\u2022 Growing Research Focus: An increasing body of research on PLF is dedicated to animal health and welfare, surpassing its traditional focus solely on production metrics.\n\u2022 Proactive Disease Prevention: Environmental sensors designed to predict disease outbreaks can indirectly prevent significant suffering and premature death among animals. Although such applications might not make animals' lives inherently worth living from an ethical standpoint, they can substantially reduce suffering for a vast number of individuals.\n\u2022 Enhancing Positive Experiences: Future AI developments are anticipated to concentrate on improving positive affective states by assessing indicators of frustration, loneliness, and boredom, thereby creating opportunities for intervention. Animal welfare scientists are actively involved in developing these technologies to ensure they genuinely benefit farmed animals, rather than merely intensifying exploitation or suffering.\n\u2022 Towards Individualized Care: PLF could enable large-scale industrial farming to partially revert to a model that incorporates individual animal care, moving beyond a purely collective management approach\n\u2022 Strengthening Accountability: Implementing robust regulations will ensure companies are held accountable for addressing (or not) any animal welfare issues identified by these PLF systems."

The interconnectedness of PLF means even small initial failures can sometimes escalate.\n\n\u2022 Severity: This can be high, potentially leading to direct animal suffering (e.g., ventilation failure causing heat stress, undetected illness) or indirect welfare declines.

Some failures are easily detectable with alarms and have straightforward fixes or manual overrides (high tractability). Others, like subtle algorithmic biases, can be harder to detect, diagnose, and resolve. Regular updates, risk assessments, and backup systems are key to improving tractability. Also, it's essential to provide staff training and create Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) that staff can follow in a situation of a technical failure.\n\nThe dependency on technology and energy raises lots of questions.

Farms might gain a false sense of security, believing welfare is well-maintained and adequate while in fact animals suffer from unmonitored issues like stress or boredom. Efforts and resources could be misdirected towards optimising flawed proxies rather than addressing genuine needs, potentially perpetuating poor conditions. Over-reliance on technology can create ethical blind spots. The focus may narrow to easily measurable data, neglecting complex welfare aspects and delaying necessary interventions if proxies are insensitive, ultimately failing to genuinely improve animals' lives.\n\nI believe that it is essential to incorporate diverse perspectives from farmers, veterinarians, animal welfare scientists, and activists when designing PLF metrics. Of course, their proposed metrics will differ, but this diversity is a strength. It ensures a more holistic overview, helping to identify a wider range of relevant factors. For instance:\n\u2022 Farmers offer invaluable practical knowledge of animal behavior, farm management realities, and the feasibility of implementing certain measures.\n\u2022 Animal Welfare Scientists contribute research-based understanding of species-specific needs, behavioural science, etc.\n\u2022 Activists and Ethicists can raise important ethical questions, challenge conventional thinking, reflect broader societal concerns, and importantly: advocate for higher welfare standards, pushing the boundaries of what's considered acceptable."

I think it's very likely there'd be animal welfare goals that might not be captured by a PLF system with the primary goal of improving productivity (for the farm). Such a system could miss measuring the animal welfare goals, and animals would continue suffering on farms. Worse, the PLF would increase the productivity and profitability of the farm -&gt; might help consolidate/grow the farm -&gt; might lead to more animals being farmed there. \n\nTractability (of the solutions the authors suggested): they seem pretty tractable to me, although I have doubts that even after we \"critically evaluate the nature and comprehensiveness of the animal welfare data that a PLF system is gathering and processing,\" it'd be another story trying to convince producers to use PLF to monitor signals that are related to animal welfare, but not related to farm productivity. Also, I see a broader gap/potential misalignment between animal welfare goals and producers' economic interests. E.g. if there's a factory farm with stacked cages for hens, the hens might exhibit \"good signals\" as measured by PLF, but if the farm doesn't have the intention to switch to cage-free, then there's only so much you can do to improve those hens' welfare.

Given the interconnectedness of regions, abolition in certain countries only would not be impactful as it could drive up production elsewhere.\n- Given the regional variation and diversity of human interests globally (lack of food security vs overconsumption of meat, agriculture as part of the cultural landscape, lack of land for small-scale production to provide enough animal protein to everyone, lack of available plant-based protein options...) the abolition of large-scale farming is not really tractable\n- Having high-level care systems that build on respectful relationships to production animals and do not lead to exploitation (similar to the relationships between humans and nature in indigenous cultures) would also lead to large impact when it comes to welfare\n- There are examples of such systems (large and small, but maybe more examples come from small-scale organic farming) and PLF and AI can be technical tools to allow for the scaling of high-level care. Ensuring that these tools are developed and regulated in a way that reflects regional differences in what may work best can be a good way forward and more tractable than abolition."

In factory farming  in many cases the quality time spent with the animals is already minimal if any. In systems where there is human-animal contact PLF may also free up time that farmers who care about the animals can spend with them pleasantly instead of e.g. treating them.\nSeverity: Medium. Depends on how the system is organized, if animals are well-cared for by machines the lack of human-animal relationships per se does not necessarily decrease welfare. However, if human contact still happens without animals being used to it and only in unpleasant situations that is a problem.\nTractability:  High. AI systems could also suggest activities for animal caretakers to perform to establish positive human-animal relationships that could provide enrichment and improve welfare. If these are performed could be tracked, also there are established methods for monitoring human-animal relationships and these could signal if something goes off."

It also avoids moral compromise - by not pursuing this path are we potentially just further entrenching systems of exploitation and normalising them by saying 'at least its better....'.  However, it requires complete cultural and systemic overhaul which takes time and significant resources to achieve.   It also risks alienating many allies and stakeholders who may be more moderate in their approach.   In the meantime, animals continue to be treated atrociously.     On the other hand, a welfarist developmetn and regulatory oversight approach is more likely to get buyin from a large proportion of the population.  It is easier to scale quickly,  and can have some significant positive benefits in a relatively short timeframe.  The risk is that the underlying social norms are not being addressed, legitimising ongoing harm, and that the perception of 'better for now' actually slows the introduction of more significant change.   I lean towards this approach however, due to the possiblity of making significant change now - where it may take decades or longer to achieve an abolitionists desired outcomes. "

                        "answer": "Critics of PLF raise valid concerns about the risk of a disconnect between animal welfare and the proxy measures used to monitor it. Welfare is a complex, multidimensional concept encompassing not just physical health, but also emotional wellbeing and the ability to express natural behaviours. PLF systems tend to focus on what is easily measurable\u2014such as movement patterns, temperature, or feed intake\u2014while overlooking indicators of psychological distress or social needs. This creates a risk of false reassurance: if the data appears \"normal,\" poor welfare conditions may persist undetected. Furthermore, interventions based solely on these metrics may miss or even exacerbate underlying issues. Over time, this gap could reinforce inadequate farming practices under the guise of technological progress particularly if farmers experienced in farm husbandry are lost in the progress.  To ensure PLF contributes meaningfully to animal welfare, it is essential to critically assess which indicators are tracked, how they are interpreted, and who defines what welfare truly means in practice.  AI may bring greater nuance to the interpretation of data, and trigger greater investigation into issues that arise to truly determine the cause.  AI may also, with work on communication, understanding movement patterns etc, give greater insight into animal welfare that PLF alone can. "

                        "answer": "Risk number 6 -Farmers/caretakers will spend less quality time with the animals\nScale-This  likely has a large scale across the livestock industry. As PLF systems become more widely adopted, especially under economic pressure, many farmers will be incentivized to expand herd sizes or cut labor costs instead of using the extra time to interact with animals. Because economies of scale are a core economic driver in factory farming, the reduction in human-animal time could become standard practice, affecting potentially millions of animals.\nSeverity-The severity is more gradual and subtle, making it harder to detect and measure. Reduced human-animal interaction might lead to less individualized care, poorer detection of  welfare problems and more objectification of animals. The psychological impacts on both animals e.g. more stress and fear and farmers e.g. detachment, reduced empathy may become more pronounced over time.\nTractability- the risk itself is moderately tractable i.e there are ways it could be reduced through better training or welfare/interaction-centered design of PLF . However, the solution of expecting farmers to voluntarily use their extra time to interact more positively with animals is low in tractability because it goes against prevailing economic incentives and farming trends.\n"

Improving regulation and oversight would be more feasible, because it can happen in smaller, more achievable steps. It would also be easier to get people on board with the idea, because farms would not necessarily lose profit in the process.\n\nHowever, I do believe that abolition of factory farming as a whole should be the long-term goal. Even with improved regulations and living conditions, animals would still be deprived of the ability to live freely, and even beneficial AI systems would be subject to error. There are also certain animal-welfare problems that cannot be solved by AI, such as animals being killed for meat. Additionally, animal agriculture is inherently part of a system that exploits animals for humans\u2019 benefit; if we abolish factory farming, that would be a major step in the journey to live in harmony with other species."

Speciesist attitudes toward animals affect all animals in some way \u2014 from farmed animals being exploited to wild animals being hunted to bugs being killed in a human\u2019s home \u2014 and it shapes all of our interactions with other species. \n\nHowever, I would say this has lower severity than many issues in the list, because the effects of societal attitudes on individual animals are not always significant. Even if humans have decreased empathy for other species, most of them would have minimal interaction with farmed animals, making this less relevant to animal welfare. It would allow them to ignore animal suffering in farms more easily, which would make it more difficult to end factory farming as a whole; however, given how little awareness there currently is, I doubt this would make the situation much worse.\n\nIn terms of tractability, I would place this in the middle of the list. We would not be able to change public perception as a whole \u2014 though we could influence it \u2014 and would not necessarily change farmers\u2019 sentiments by speaking with them. However, we could work with farmers to develop uses of AI that do not remove their personal interactions with animals, and potentially use AI to create greater connection between animals and farmers, and even the general public. For example, using data collected through PLF, AI could tell the stories of individual animals, creating greater empathy.

Animal advocates have worked toward that mission for a long time, but intensive farming is just so entrenched in society.\n\nI believe that steering the development and regulation of PLF is currently a more impactful and tractable approach. Since PLF is a relatively new area without established norms, we have a unique window of opportunity to influence its trajectory. There is also a rare chance to align the incentives of the animal agriculture industry with those of animal advocates. If we can do that successfully, even with just a few targeted PLF technologies, it may be one of the most promising ways to create meaningful change.\n\nThose with opposing views might argue that working on PLF means condoning harm to animals or selling out by working with animal ag. But in reality, animal advocates are a small minority, and we must be pragmatic about how we create change. Animals do not benefit from our moral purity. They benefit from tangible improvements in their lives. As PLF becomes more widespread, we must shape it proactively, rather than reactively, before the window for meaningful influence closes.\n\nAll that being said, I don't think we have enough evidence to make a definitive either-or choice, and different approaches may be appropriate in different contexts."

In the US alone, we already farm around 10 billion animals each year.

(2023) is the potential for Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) to lead to the loss of animal-oriented husbandry skills among farmers and stockpersons. Scale: This risk is substantial, as PLF technologies are increasingly adopted across various farming systems globally. As automation handles more tasks traditionally performed by humans, the reliance on human observation and interaction diminishes. This widespread adoption could result in a broad loss of traditional husbandry skills. Severity: The severity is considerable. Traditional husbandry skills involve nuanced understanding and responsiveness to individual animals' needs, which are crucial for ensuring animal welfare. The erosion of these skills may lead to delayed detection of health issues, reduced empathy towards animals, and a decline in overall welfare standards. Tractability: Addressing this risk is moderately tractable. Implementing training programs that emphasize the importance of maintaining traditional husbandry skills alongside PLF technologies can mitigate this risk. Encouraging a hybrid approach that combines technological tools with human expertise may preserve essential skills. Uncertainties: The extent to which PLF adoption directly causes skill loss is not fully quantified. Variability in PLF implementation across different farming systems may influence the degree of impact. The effectiveness of interventions to preserve husbandry skills in the context of increasing automation remains to be thoroughly evaluated. In summary, while PLF offers advancements in monitoring and managing livestock, it poses a significant risk to the preservation of essential animal-oriented husbandry skills. Proactive measures are necessary to ensure that technological progress does not come at the expense of animal welfare."

I honestly can't imagine a future where the majority (or even a salient minority) of people in any country care about animal welfare enough to ban factory farming-- at best, I could see lab grown meat becoming economically competitive to factory farmed animals, but with general attitudes towards GMOs, I doubt it (ex. golden rice).\nPro Welfarism/Using PFL\n- Technology allows a level of individualized care that would be physically impossible for human caretakers to perform-- monitoring vitals, eating, and behavior is all possible now, but automatic medical care, enrichment, etc could all be possible in the future.\n- Future technology likely will evaluate animal psychological wellbeing as well as or better than humans and could give animals better lives than even the idyllic fantasy of a small time farmer who loves his animals. (Obviously, I would personally argue that giving animals amazing lives then slaughtering them for food would still be inherently unethical. But since I am skeptical that veganism will ever be mainstream, I would far prefer animals have enjoyable lives if they are to be killed for food.)\nPro Abolition\n- Rather than entrench speciesism and meat consumption, tackles root cause of animal suffering. We don't even know if PFL will objectively improve animals' lives, so why should we work on it? (i.e. PFL is not tractable because improvements to PFL might not correlate to animal welfare improvements.) Perhaps even if PFL improves animal welfare, it will accordingly also make animal farming more productive, so people can afford to eat more meat. So animals might have better lives, but more are killed overall.\n- Removing humans from the loop will make people even more unempathetic to and separated from animals.\n- Developing PFL with the hope of making it aligned with animal welfare might just end up causing a PFL to develop faster and neglect animal welfare (e.g. a AI arms race/Eliezer Yudkowsky situation)"

In reality, it risks reinforcing and expanding low-welfare practices under the disguise of innovation. \nThat said, proponents of PLF raise important points:\n- Short-term welfare gains: Millions of animals are suffering now in FF. If AI can reduce pain or better their physical health and prevent diseases through tracking, it could meaningfully improve quality of live of animals already who are already trapped in these systems. \n- Abolition is politically and economically difficult (if not impossible?): Given current consumer demand, economic interests, and political realties, abolition may be unrealistic in the near term.

But, we don't live in an ideal world, and chances of us reaching this point in the near future are not likely, because these issues are not only about animal and human lives but are entrenched in political discourse and ideologies of colonization that stem from early modern human farming practices. It seems that at the current time, welfarist views are the most important to emphasize in practice because they lead to slow but steady change towards abolition.

                        "answer": "The question of whether to focus on the outright abolition of factory farming or on the welfarist development and regulatory oversight of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) involves weighing different strategic priorities. Arguments for concentrating on abolition emphasize that factory farming is inherently unethical, causing widespread suffering that PLF might merely optimize rather than resolve. This approach aims for a fundamental systemic change in our relationship with food animals and seeks to prevent \"humane-washing,\" where technology could make an unacceptable system seem more palatable, thereby delaying its ultimate dismantlement.\n\nConversely, focusing on welfarist development and regulatory oversight of PLF is often seen as a more pragmatic approach. Given that abolition is a formidable long-term challenge with significant economic and political hurdles, working to guide PLF development can achieve tangible welfare improvements for millions of animals much sooner. This path involves harm reduction; if PLF's adoption is inevitable, then influencing its design and implementation can help mitigate severe suffering, for instance, by ensuring sensors effectively detect and flag pain or distress. It also offers an opportunity to steer innovation, allowing animal protection advocates to embed welfare-centric metrics into these technologies from their inception.\n\nWhile the ultimate goal for many remains the abolition of factory farming, I believe that concurrently focusing on the welfarist development and regulatory oversight of PLF is currently a more impactful and tractable route for immediate animal protection. Factory farming is not disappearing in the short term, and PLF technologies are being rapidly adopted. To ignore this development would be to lose a critical opportunity to influence a technology that will affect billions of animals. Strategic engagement can help steer PLF towards tools that genuinely reduce suffering within the current system, even if the system itself remains deeply problematic. Of course, this approach is not without risks; it could inadvertently legitimize or entrench factory farming by making it appear more acceptable, and resources dedicated to PLF regulation might be seen as diverted from more direct abolitionist efforts."

                        "answer": "Considering the risks discussed in PLF literature, such as by Tuyttens and colleagues, one significant concern is the potential for over-reliance on PLF technology leading to a decline in stockperson vigilance, essential animal husbandry skills, and the quality of human-animal interaction. The scale of this risk is potentially very large, as PLF systems become more widespread across major livestock sectors globally, affecting millions of stockpeople and billions of animals. The severity is high because if stockpeople become deskilled or less directly observant, subtle signs of distress, disease, or injury that sensors might miss could go unnoticed for longer periods, leading to prolonged animal suffering. Furthermore, a reduction in positive human-animal interactions can be detrimental to animal welfare, potentially increasing fear and stress, and in instances of critical system failure, animal welfare could be severely compromised if human oversight is inadequate.\n\nAddressing this risk is moderately difficult. Mitigation strategies could include mandating minimum levels of human oversight, designing PLF primarily as a decision-support tool rather than a complete replacement for human judgment, and implementing continuous training programs for stockpeople that emphasize both technological competence and traditional animal observation skills. Explicitly incorporating protocols for positive human-animal interaction could also be beneficial. However, challenges persist, notably the economic pressures to reduce labor costs, which is often a key driver for PLF adoption. Ensuring that training programs are effective and that PLF genuinely complements rather than supplants human skills is also a complex task. There remain several uncertainties: the actual extent to which PLF will lead to a reduction in stockperson skills versus potentially freeing up their time for more quality interactions is still unclear. It's also uncertain how we can effectively measure the impact of reduced or changed human interaction on various species within PLF settings, and what the long-term psychological effects might be on stockpeople who transition from hands-on caregivers to data managers."

                        "answer": "The potential \"gap\" between what PLF systems measure and the actual holistic welfare of animals presents several significant risks. If PLF tracks only a narrow set of proxy measures, such as growth rate, feed intake, or core body temperature, it can create a misleading picture of animal welfare. Animals might appear \"fine\" according to these limited metrics while simultaneously experiencing significant suffering in other domains, such as boredom, frustration from confinement, fear, or chronic pain that doesn't clearly manifest in the chosen proxies. For example, a sow confined in a gestation crate might register acceptable physical health on PLF sensors but endure severe psychological deprivation. This leads to the risk of optimizing for the wrong things; if PLF primarily tracks production-linked indicators, the system will invariably be geared towards enhancing these, potentially at the expense of unmeasured but crucial welfare aspects like the ability to perform natural behaviors. We might also see \"Goodhart's Law\" in effect: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. If farmers are primarily incentivized based on PLF scores from narrow proxies, their efforts will naturally focus on improving those specific scores, even if doing so does not reflect genuine holistic welfare improvement or, worse, actively harms welfare in unmeasured ways. This over-reliance on technological data points can foster a reductionist view of animals, obscuring their complex emotional and behavioral needs that are not easily quantified by current sensor technology. Consequently, key welfare deficits, such as lack of environmental enrichment or social stress, might persist or even worsen if they are not being actively measured or flagged by the PLF system. Ultimately, positive readings from PLF systems based on limited proxies could generate a false sense of security and complacency among producers, regulators, and consumers, leading them to incorrectly believe that animal welfare is adequately addressed."

                        "answer": "It's a tough decision. Given human nature, I think trying to shoot for abolition of factory farming as a first step will lead to missed opportunities in helping many farmed animals. A better roadmap might be PLF in the short term, and then abolition in the long term. But I am cautious of the unintended consequences of PLF (e.g. gains made are reinvested in the bottom line and we have a \"torture at an AI scale\" type of situation)\n\nArguments for focusing on steering development and regulation of PLF/AI:\n\n* Precision Livestock Farming, incorporating AI and sensors, holds great potential to significantly improve the health and welfare of the billions of animals currently within the industrial farming system, potentially offering benefits unmatched in recent decades.\n* Many initial applications of PLF/AI, such as detecting disease early, preventing injuries like piglet crushing, or optimising environmental conditions, align both welfare and productivity/profit interests, making these welfare improvements economically viable and more likely to be adopted.\n* Actively engaging with and steering the development of PLF/AI through specific ethical principles and regulations is considered a more realistic and tractable path than attempting a complete ban. A ban would be difficult to define and enforce and would prevent the potential welfare improvements offered by the technology from being realised.\n"

                        "answer": "Both are certainly imperfect, and entail inevitable suffering.\nAbolition has been defended for centuries and doesn\u2019t seem to have dented the industry. I don\u2019t expect continuous pushing for abolition with current strategies is likely in the years to come, though assuming an absence of radical changes in overall societal structures in the decades to come, new strategies like that pursued by Pro-Animal Future might increase our minuscule likelihood of attaining important shifts. Thus, continuing to push in a direction where change doesn\u2019t seem tractable at all seems like a bad idea to me if we wish to prevent the extreme suffering of animals.\nHowever, the correlation between PLF and welfare is important. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019re biased in finding it easier to think of ways a situation could get better rather than worse, and so it\u2019s tempting to think that any change in factory farming will result in net suffering being reduced. Giving the immense impact such technologies could have, there seem to be reasons to be skeptical. Moreover, inventions like Atarraya\u2019s autonomous shrimp farm are a clear indication that PLF will cause net suffering in some sectors. There\u2019s a bit of wishful thinking in betting on PLF, in my view.\nMy conclusion would be: abolition is currently not very promising, though it could be important in some worldviews to allocate some resources to well-thought out abolitionist projects; PLF could go either way and seems to carry large risks; nonetheless, it makes sense somewhat to focus on PLF, conditional on us believing that it will inevitably become the reality in the future, because it will then be important to try to steer it towards more consideration of animal welfare."

However, most of the impact on individuals here will come from what kinds of farming systems are most \u201coptimized\u201d by PLF. Right now, being mostly focused on making the farming of big animals more efficient, we could expect it to lead to the exploitation of large animals becoming more profitable, and replacing that of smaller animals. However, forms of monitoring can also be helpful for smaller animals, who often die in large numbers in factory farms. Right now, this had been less of a central focus, but more \u201ceffective\u201d fish, shrimp (see Shrimpox) and insect farms could make the number rise to \u201cthousands of billions of individuals affected\u201d. This seems like the most important question here.\nSeverity: factory farming at its most intense yet \u201clife-preserving\u201d (without consideration for suffering) level probably causes some of the most intense suffering there is. Thus, PLF causing more animals to live in intensive farms seems very negative for overall suffering.\nTractability: I\u2019m fairly pessimistic about this, though it seems far from impossible, as preventive measures have somewhat of a track record, and there exists a public suspicion of technology mingling in food production in unusual ways. The tractability will depend on exterior factors, like how economically advantageous new PLF-driven factory farming will actually be. If it\u2019s not particularly more profitable, it could be easier for advocates to defend a  moratorium on PLF systems. However, if these do turn out to make intensification much easier and more effective, industry lobbying against such legislation should be expected to be very strong, making animal advocates inaudible.

I base this mainly on the premise that abolition, at least at present, is difficult to achieve given the huge demand and financial support for factory farming. Improvements in welfare as a result of PLF, on the other hand, are far easier to achieve. Some forms of PLF can improve both welfare and productivity (consider PLF which can track and address disease quickly). This makes the interests of farmers and animal welfarists aligned, allowing for the quick adoption of technology which can reduce animal suffering at a large scale. \n\t\n\n\tAbolitionist objection 1:\n\tThere is no reason to think that PLF will be employed to improve animal welfare. Instead, it will be employed to increase profit. \n\n\tMy response:\n\tSome PLF which is used for profit will also benefit animal welfare (e.g. disease detection). Furthermore, it is much easier to push for welfare enhancing PLF than to push for abolition. \n\t\n\n\tAbolitionist objection 2: \n\tPLF leads to \"humane-washing\", resulting in people continuing to eat factory farmed animal products, rather than seeing it as the evil it is. This results in factory farming continuing, leading to more animal suffering. \n\t\n\tMy response:\nMany people are aware of factory farming, yet still continue to eat factory farmed animal products. What is needed in order for people to move away from factory farming is an alternative to factory farmed animal products. Lab-grown meat is one such alternative. When such technology becomes widespread and the cost is significantly decreased, people will be much more likely to move away from factory farming. While we wait for this alternative to arrive, improving animal welfare via PLF is the best thing we can do now to massively decrease animal suffering. "

E.g. area covered in extensive systems is too large. This could lead to housing conditions that are worse for animal welfare, if doing so makes PLF more effective and thus more profitable. \n\nFurthermore, if PLF is more profitable for intensive systems than extensive systems, this could lead to intensive systems outcompeting extensive systems even more, which could in turn lead to worse animal welfare. \n\nScale - very large: could affect all livestock \nSeverity - medium/large: depends on what kind of housing systems are most profitable using PLF. If the most profitable housing systems are barren and cramped, this could of course lead to severe suffering.

The farmers will only attend to the animals as and when is needed, usually when the PLF system flags an issue with the individual animal. So when the animals do interact with humans, the animals are not used to said interactions hence they might feel more distressed and upset.\n\nIn this case, through the application of PLF, it will affect the lives of millions, if not billions of farmed animals. I would say that the impact of PLF can either be positive as it can address the pain points of animals and giving more free time to farmers to tend to their animals, or it can be used to scale up operations to generate more profit using the same amount of workforce. If regulation is pushed to the masses before the application of PLF becomes an industry-wide standard, we could address possible threats such as the one currently discussed more efficiently and effectively, hence better control of how PLF is used throughout the farming industry."

But PLF will not improve the cow's original situation. The most PLF seems to offer farmed animals are mild improvements that coincidentally benefit producers' bottom lines (such as automated body sensors that are less intrusive than the alternative or trackers that allow animals to move greater distances).\nAnd much more alarmingly, PLF will be used to dramatically increase the number of cows in her position, increasing the overall amount of suffering exponentially. There is no indication that the animal agriculture industry has any interest in providing even modest improvements for animals, as evidenced by the difficulty of banning cages in egg and pig production in the Global North."

                        "answer": "eciding whether to focus on abolishing factory farming or shaping the future of Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) isn\u2019t easy. Both paths are deeply important, and both affect the lives of billions of animals. On one hand, factory farming is the biggest source of animal suffering today. Animals live in confinement, subjected to cruelty for the sake of profit. We\u2019re finally making progress, laws are shifting, plant-based options are rising, and public awareness is growing. Abandoning this effort now would feel like giving up just before a breakthrough, which would be bad given the resources and time spent. Morally, it\u2019s clear: factory farming must end. But on the other hand, PLF, a high-tech, AI-driven system for managing animals, could be the future. And that\u2019s exactly the concern. It might become a more advanced, more hidden version of factory farming, automated, data-driven, and harder to monitor. Yet, PLF isn\u2019t inherently bad. It\u2019s not limited to cruel systems. It can be used in more humane settings or even to monitor wild animal welfare. It\u2019s a tool, and tools can be steered. The emotional conflict is real: urgency to stop suffering now vs. responsibility to prevent harm tomorrow. There\u2019s fear of a worse system replacing the old, but also hope that we can shape it for good. Ultimately, the most impactful path may not be choosing one over the other, but connecting both. We can finish the fight against factory farming while influencing how PLF evolves. That way, we not only end current cruelty but also ensure we don\u2019t create new forms of suffering in its place. Additionally, the challenge of PLF is similar to the question of whether a gun should have been invented or not, given the fact that it has the potential to end a life swiftly."

Scale: High PLF systems are being deployed across industries that handle billions of animals, especially poultry, pigs, and dairy. However, most current tools monitor productivity, not welfare (e.g. pain or stress). As a result, vast numbers of animals may suffer unseen and unaddressed, making the scale of risk enormous. Severity: High The absence of meaningful indicators (like distress calls or injury detection) means animals can endure chronic suffering in highly automated environments. This creates a false impression of welfare and makes cruelty harder to detect or prove. The impact on animal lives is , deep and long-term. Tractability: Moderate to High Technologically, better indicators are possible, like using AI for behavioural cues or stress biomarkers. Practically, adoption is slowed by cost concerns, industry priorities, and weak regulations. Still, animal welfare advocates, scientists, and policymakers can shape the direction PLF takes with targeted pressure. key uncertainties. 1. Definition Uncertainty: There's no clear consensus on what counts as a \"meaningful\" welfare indicator, should it focus only on suffering, or also include positive welfare? 2. Data Availability: PLF tools are often proprietary, so it's unclear what welfare data is actually being collected or used. 3. Adoption vs. Potential: Even if welfare indicators exist, it\u2019s uncertain whether farms will adopt them over cheaper, productivity-focused metrics. 4. Ethical &amp; Political Influence: It\u2019s unclear who will shape PLF\u2019s future, industry, regulators, or advocates, making its ethical direction unpredictable."

                        "answer": "For chickens, issues like lameness, overcrowding, and cannibalism may go unaddressed if systems focus only on growth. Bone deformities and heart failure may arise due to breeding pressures. In pigs, tail biting, stress, pain from mutilations, and stereotypic behaviours could persist undetected without proper social or pain metrics. For cattle, welfare risks like lameness, mastitis, calf-mother separation, and zero-grazing distress may remain invisible if only milk yield or weight is tracked. Other species like ducks, turkeys, goats, and sheep face being excluded from PLF design, making their unique welfare needs (e.g., water access for ducks, pain from tail docking in sheep) overlooked. Across all species, AI systems might automate cruelty, give a false sense of welfare, and cause ethical washing, appearing humane while animals suffer silently. How AI might exacerbate such 'suffering risks'? AI in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) can worsen animal suffering by optimising productivity over welfare, hiding distress behind \u201cgreen\u201d dashboards, and scaling harm rapidly. Poorly designed systems may miss pain, fear, or stress, especially in underrepresented species. Data gaps, biased training, and reduced human oversight further risk silent suffering. AI can also be used for \u201cwelfare-washing,\u201d masking cruelty as innovation. Without ethical safeguards, AI may automate and entrench widespread suffering. How might we reduce them? Reducing AI-driven suffering in PLF means designing systems around real animal welfare, not just productivity. Key steps include using species-specific welfare indicators, ensuring transparency, building ethical failsafes, improving training data, supporting human oversight, aligning policy incentives, and involving animal advocates in tech design.\n\n"

At the end of the day, even working toward a highly regulated factory farming scenario where animals are treated humanely, with their welfare in mind, will be because the welfare affects their value in a positive manner in terms of their use for the farmer/ system itself, and if the ultimate goal is to not have hierarchies in the value of any life, then it cannot be to capitalize on another creature's existence. I work in regulation in another industry, and I see the word of the interpretation of the regulation being followed, without the actual purpose/ intent of the regulation being satisfied all the time. We have laws in our human world too, how many of those work the way they were intended ? When we cant even establish regulations to respect the same species, I cynically believe that regulation has the potential to improve welfare to some extent, providing the illusion of ethical sustainability, built on the foundation of animal slavery in the end, where we play God to creating more and more farmed animals to feed our own growing population.

Tractability: Low - medium: The regulation would have to clearly define what harm looks like- who decides? who enforces? And who benefits? are key questions, all of which point to many differing voices in this space.

Eventually this should be the goal but because animal agriculture is so deeply embedded, shooting for this right away might cause more resistance.\n\nPLF Animal Welfare: This is a much more attainable goal in the near-term which could be implemented with the current infrastructure and social climate. However, it can't solve the complete problem of animals being raised fundamentally as livestock and could cause people to have a false sense of morality which could further intrench the issue."

With the consolidation of livestock farming operations, the majority are raised in large factory farms which could implement PLF and has the potential to over-index on what can be measured rather than what is actually valuable for an animal.\n\nDepending on how it is implemented the severity could differ. If farmers simply game the measuring system it's possible that the animals could live in even worse conditions than they currently do even though the metrics say the opposite.\n\nThis issue may be tough to gain traction because holistic animal welfare is by it's nature, tough to measure, and thus, tough to strategically improve. Rather than aiming for the most obvious metrics of animal welfare, this may require further studies into what animals really want and whether that can be provided and demonstrated in PLF."

In many cases animals' and producers' interests are aligned, e.g. preventing disease and injury and mortalities.\n- Factory farming isn't going to disappear overnight. While we work towards abolition we need to focus on making it as close to ethical as possible in the meantime.\n- Governments and the public are becoming more compassionate towards animals so society will probably ensure that PLF is only used in their interests, not solely for corporate profit.\n- PLF gives us an unprecedented opportunity to closely monitor huge numbers of animals and analyse the data to understand more about their subjective experiences and how to allow them to lead good lives.\n\nMy view:\n- PLF will never make factory farming an acceptable part of society and corporate interests will typically trump animals' interests, just as they have in every other facet of factory farming.

So far autonomous farming has been very focussed on insects, fishes, and shrimps - this makes sense given they are way smaller so easier to pack into a pre-fabricated system, supposedly have less complex welfare needs, and aren't as likely to arouse public sympathy. Unfortunately they're also the animals that we farm in the highest numbers and whose welfare needs we least understand. There are some signs that this could start being used for other animals too; e.g. China's semi-automated 'pork skyscrapers', project proposals for almost entirely automated chicken farms, and Vertical Oceans' stated belief that their aquaculture tech could also be applied to chickens and cows. This seems like this will all add to the general tendency of animal farming being an invisible process where we get to enjoy the product without having to be confronted with how it was produced.

                        "answer": "Farmers tend to conflate welfare and productivity. By their logic, animals need to be healthy in order to be productive, and if they're healthy that means they have good welfare. AI models designed to prioritize productivity over all else could be incredibly damaging as it would mean e.g. a) increasing stocking densities, b) increasing the 'yield' per animal, and c) being prepared to adopt approaches that harm or neglect many individuals in pursuit of increasing the productivity of the overall flock. Similarly, AI models designed to prioritize health could seriously jeopardize animal welfare. This already happens: producers justify keeping animals in indoor caged systems because there's a lower chance of disease spread. The same goes for physical injury; producers justify keeping animals in indoor caged systems because there's a lower chance of them injuring themselves. While health and physical injury have to factor into a model of welfare, they can't be used as justifications to cage animals at the expense of their psychological wellbeing. Also if AI models are trained to measure good/bad welfare solely on the basis of physical indicators like heart rate, this risks completely misdiagnosing the situation; an animal might have a high heart rate because they're excited or because they're afraid. Models need to be nuanced enough to recognise the difference. You can also imagine mortality being used as a proxy for good welfare, with farms having to achieve less than 1% mortality rate in order to be diagnosed 'high-welfare'. This would be a huge s-risk if it meant that AI models prioritized keeping horribly sick or injured animals alive when the more ethical approach would be to euthanize them. We need a much better understanding of animal welfare science for us to understand what good welfare looks like for different animals. This will vary from animal to animal and over the animal's life; e.g. young chickens have very different preferences to older chickens. AI can help us build this understanding by monitoring animals' behaviour and physiological state in many different situations, and monitoring their preferences based on what they eat, where they like to sleep, nest, forage, etc. But this needs to be coupled with human understanding and common sense."

For instance, an animal confined in a high-density cage might show no physiological distress (normal temperature, heart rate, etc.), yet still experience emotional suffering due to lack of space or stimulation; conditions the sensors might overlook. If there is a gap between actual welfare and the proxy measures tracked by PLF, animals could appear \u201cfine\u201d by technical standards while enduring prolonged and unrecognized suffering.\n\nProponents of AI in PLF suggest that these systems could one day track individual welfare.

Whether it's a factory-farming scenario or large animal sanctuary operations (one for animal slaughter and the other for animal protection and long-term care) PLF tech can significantly improve the welfare and experiences of animals in both scenarios. PLF can measure negative animal experiences (measure stress, distress, frustration, sickness, etc.) and positive experiences and make important decisions. Whether or not factory farming is abolished, focusing on tech to improve animal experiences can benefit large scale and small scale animal operations.\n\nContrarily, the case that factory farming should be abolished is that PLF may prolong and encourage more crueler forms of factory farming. In addition to the risk that operations could be maximized for PLF and efficient productivity and less for animal welfare, other risks associated with including PLF in factory farming include: more invasive sensors and devices, potentially adding to discomfort and distress and possibility of tech failure; failure to capture or properly assess distress behaviors for wide spread animals; significant failures could be catastrophically overlooked from the reliance leading to undetected suffering for animals (even consumers).

It would take a massive cultural shift to stop the capitalist machine that dictates the need for factory farming. \nWelfarist development: \nFor: We can train AI to be more ethical and welfare oriented than farmers. 2.

Currently, generative AI has frequent systemic errors that slow chat AI or reasoning errors, like the inability to remember what day it is. Combined with power outages and weather-related problems, AI-powered PLF could be a nightmare of disasters. \nIt is a large-scale problem as factory farming has become the norm worldwide. If half of those operations used PLF, and the same type of problems affected systems that control feeding or animal welfare, it could lead to large-scale suffering. AI cannot reason well enough currently to be in charge of living animals. We see this in different business simulations where AI threatens bodily harm to another AI business if they don't comply, or that AI changes the rules of the simulation to be successful. If AI were programmed for financial gain only, it could lead to dystopian animal welfare scenarios. The suffering of factory farms is already so great; adding the worry that AI could mistake a cow for a threat, or stop feeding animals mistakenly, is horrifying. Currently, the possibility of basic mechanical failures from power outages or weather disasters already affects factory farms, increasing the severity of possible suffering.  \n\nAs for tractability, I think right now, as AI is becoming commonplace, is the time to get ahead of the problem. We can't let 'big ag' be the ones to set the bar on suffering or AI ethics. I also don't believe people who are simply in the computer/AI space should be the ones who set the rules. It needs to be people from many walks of life- business, underserved communities, animal welfare, and farmers from small and large farms that work together to make the rules and hopefully laws. "

Consumers might buy the animal products, assuming the metrics meant that the animals were treated ethically and humanely. Once the general public finds out, it could lead to a backlash, somewhat like the recycling backlash, where some people feel all waste, recyclable or not, ends up in the trash, so there is no use in recycling.

This can lead to animals becoming less habituated to humans and a reduction in human attention to individuals, potentially increasing fear during handling and reducing the farmer's ability to detect subtle problems. This also risks objectifying animals, as less interaction may reduce empathy. In terms of scale: this could affect the lives of millions of animals kept in intensive systems, and drive an increase in the number of animals. In terms of severity: the disconnection of animals as sentient beings from the owners/workers could worsen the already poor relationship some people have with animals. Traceability: disconnection with the animals as sentient beings don't necessarily affect the traceability, although the \u00a8mechanization\u00a8 of these procedures could potentially reduce the interest of people/consumers in understanding what is going on with the animals or where they come from.

Why bother sharing the fact and acknowledging heart-warming truths such as cows having best friends, if we can quickly and conveniently forget that knowledge when ordering a steak? Why does the concept of welfare and protection not include the preservation of life--why stop at minimising pain and suffering? \n\nThe question of which perspective/approach is better presumes a false equivalence in their goals: abolitionists are not concerned just with improving metrics of animal welfare and suffering but also intangible, epistemic concerns re: our non-human animal and animal relationship: why do we enact the presumed right to eat animals (some over others), especially when there is indisputable facts that the animals we eat are sentient and capable of experiencing deep emotions and pain? Why are we not throwing billions at alt. protein research and lab-grown meat, which will enable us to still enjoy meat but without the suffering? "

While I won\u2019t delve into those details, it is important to note that abolition theory remains the ideal goal we are striving toward.\n\nArguments in Favor of Abolition:\n1. Ending factory farming would liberate animals from commodification, exploitation, and systematic abuse, both physically and emotionally. No sentient being should endure mass suffering when it is avoidable.\n2.Abolition could serve as a catalyst for dismantling broader social injustices beyond the realm of animal welfare.\n3.It would significantly curb environmental degradation and reduce migrant labor exploitation, addressing critical humanitarian and ecological concerns.\n\nArguments Against Abolition:\n\n1. Abolition, like Marxist theories, may seem utopian and unrealistic given the current economic landscape. While welfarists ultimately share the goal of abolition, they advocate for a gradual transition, emphasizing improved welfare measures and regulations along the way.\n2. There is a stark lack of regional and local outreach within the current Effective Altruism (EA) and vegan movements. Most research, campaigns, and policy initiatives disproportionately focus on privileged, high-income societies. Until these disparities are addressed, the shift toward total abolition will remain unattainable."

In the short term, the declining prices of meat and animal products may help lower- and middle-class consumers manage inflation. But over time, however, factory farming expansion could worsen wealth inequality as corporations monopolize farmland and displace indigenous communities, destroying both habitats and livelihoods. It will reduce human labor, leading to potential wage suppression and job losses in agricultural sectors dependent on factory farming practices."

By using this economic incentive, perhaps we can implement technology that greatly improves welfare.\n- Again, from an economical point of view, farmers that don't implement these technologies might be out-competed and go out of business. Therefore, PLF might be inevitable and hence efforts should be diverted to ensuring it maximises welfare.\nOn the other hand,\n- I completely agree that trusting AI too much into the farm might cause human dependence on it as many forget how to care for the animals. This is dangerous as AI, at least in its current stage, can still frequently malfunction and many animal lives can be lost as a result of this.\n- In the above bullet points, I talked about this 'marriage' between productivity and welfare. The problem is that this relationship only extends so far, and at one point it might be more productive to reduce animal welfare. Thus, regulations and safeguards must be put in place to draw the line and ensure this technology is not used for the worse."

Even with the current technological breakthroughs, AI does sometimes prove that it does not think, but rather reiterates. Hence, it would be great in some cases for automation, but when an irregular sized,  etc. animal comes it may struggle to assess it and may even assess it dangerously.\nThis brings me onto severity: Depending on the circumstance, this can be quite severe. AI cannot always predict what is best for the animal and research on animal emotion might still be too limited for AI to be trained on it. Hence, it might not always take the action best for the animal but for the human (the productive one), and this may result in animal welfare negligence.\nTractability: As AI progresses more and more, we hope to see less of this. If this technology is implemented in farms internationally, then the AI would very likely have a big enough data set to be able to (somewhat) deal with anomalies. The problem is that for it to develop this knowledge, it might make irreversible mistakes on unsuspecting, innocent animals in the meantime."

This is something that could be tracked by PLF and optimised to an extreme, where the animals are too warm and uncomfortable, but at their maximum productivity."

If there is a gap between true welfare and these proxies, several risks emerge. First, animals may appear \u201chealthy\u201d by sensor data while still experiencing chronic stress, boredom, fear, or social deprivation, harms that go undetected because they are harder to quantify. Second, reliance on narrow proxies may incentivize farms to optimize for metrics rather than wellbeing, reinforcing harmful systems as long as numbers \u201clook good.\u201d Third, public and regulatory trust could be eroded if technologies advertised as promoting welfare actually obscure suffering.

                        "answer": "Work toward abolition as the ultimate goal while simultaneously steering current technologies like Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) to minimize harm and facilitate a transition. This dual approach recognizes the moral urgency of ending factory farming while also acknowledging the complex realities of global food systems. While abolition provides a clear ethical horizon, engaging with PLF offers a pragmatic route to alleviating immediate suffering and shaping the current system toward greater accountability. By actively participating in the regulation and ethical development of PLF, we can ensure that technological advancements are not misused to further entrench exploitation, but instead serve as a bridge to more humane and sustainable models. Moreover, supporting innovation in plant-based proteins, cellular agriculture, and non-animal testing technologies aligns with a long-term vision of disconnecting human progress from animal harm. Leveraging AI in these areas provides scalable, science-driven alternatives that reduce dependency on animal farming while promoting resilience in food security, public health, and environmental sustainability. In this way, abolition is not a static demand but a dynamic process one that requires strategic foresight, ethical consistency, and interdisciplinary collaboration to bring about meaningful systemic change."

                        "answer": "Threat 2: Effects of the PLF System on Animals Risk Selected: Animal stress and welfare degradation due to challenges in adapting to automated feeding or milking systems in Precision Livestock Farming (PLF). Scale: This risk is significant in industrial dairy and pig farming, where millions of animals are subjected to automated systems like robotic milking. The issue is especially pronounced in high-density, zero-grazing environments, affecting a large proportion of animals across various regions. Uncertainty: The exact prevalence of adaptation failure is not thoroughly documented, and there may be regional variations in PLF system design and the resilience of different animal breeds. Severity: The severity is high for animals that struggle to adapt, leading to chronic hunger, exclusion from feeding groups, increased aggression, and physical decline. Vulnerable social dynamics, particularly for subordinate animals, exacerbate the issue, resulting in malnutrition, anxiety, and weakened immunity. The psychological impact, including fear and frustration, is hard to measure due to limited data. Uncertainty: The full psychological impact on animals (such as prolonged fear or frustration) is difficult to measure due to limited data on their subjective experiences and underreporting in commercial settings. Tractability: Moderate tractability exists, with potential interventions like intuitive system interfaces, monitoring for non-adaptive animals, and tailored designs based on species and social dynamics. However, economic pressures on commercial farms often prioritize efficiency over animal welfare, creating challenges for implementation. Collaboration between engineers and animal behaviorists is also limited."

                        "answer": "Dairy Cattle If we only measure welfare by milk yield, feed intake, and movement patterns, we might miss animals suffering from chronic stress, social isolation, or subtle pain. We might overlook natural behaviors like lying together, grooming, and grazing, which can lead to increased anxiety, frustration, or lameness. Pigs AI systems may consider pigs \"healthy\" based on feeding habits and weight gain, but they can overlook issues like tail biting, aggression, or lack of social interaction in crowded pens. These environments may be designed for maximum output rather than for the animals' enrichment, resulting in boredom and repeated behaviors (like bar biting). Broiler Chickens We often assess the welfare of broiler chickens by their growth rate and death rates. However, these birds are bred to grow so quickly that their bodies may struggle to keep up. If AI systems do not consider their ability to move, diverse behaviors, or quality of rest, these chickens may suffer quietly in highly automated settings. How AI May Increase Suffering Risks Focusing on Wrong Targets AI and Precision Livestock Farming may prioritize indicators (like feed conversion ratios or weight gain) that value productivity over actual animal well-being. Less Human Interaction As we rely more on AI, we may have less direct interaction with animals, leading to a delayed recognition of suffering signs (like unusual sounds or social withdrawal)."

Yet, their remoteness from daily human life might mean the novelty fades, with few structural changes to how we relate to the natural world. In contrast, if pigs were the first to speak, the consequences could be immediate and morally jarring. Farmed animals, long treated as commodities, would suddenly present us with firsthand accounts of suffering. This could trigger a profound ethical reckoning, challenging global food systems and prompting calls for reform. However, once the emotional shock wears off, attention might shift toward animals with whom people already have strong bonds. If cats and dogs were the first to talk, the response would likely be deeply personal. Pet owners would reshape their daily routines, housing policies might adapt, and animals could gain new legal and emotional standing within families. But this path also risks reinforcing a narrow moral circle, elevating beloved pets while continuing to overlook farmed or wild animals. The order of discovery matters: pets first might delay broader justice, pigs first might catalyze change that loses momentum, and whales first might create wonder without real consequence. Whomever we hear from first will shape not just how we see animals, but who we allow ourselves to care about in the long run."

This might lead to significant confusion for the animals and unforeseen ecological damage, the full extent of which we might only recognise retrospectively, once substantial harm has occured.\nBeyond tourism, corporations or governments might try to exploit their knowledge for resource extraction (e.g., \"Where are the richest fishing grounds?\" \"Where are mineral deposits?\"\nOn the other hand, they could actively inform us about threats such as illegal whaling. This could lead to more effective and targeted conservation. And potentially, it could profoundly alter our understanding of intelligence, consciousness, and our place in the natural world.\n\nWith pigs and other farmed animals, I could imagine that we would become even more ignorant as well as it would contribute to the speciesism. The sheer horror of understanding their fear, pain, and awareness of their fate in factory farms could be so overwhelming that society, or large parts of it, might double down on denial. They might actively discredit the communication, label it as \"misleading,\" or develop even more elaborate justifications to continue the status quo. This would be a profound and tragic form of speciesism \u2013 acknowledging their voice only to consciously ignore it.\nAt the same time, For many, it could make meat consumption from current systems untenable. This would likely trigger: a massive surge in vegetarianism and veganism; intense demand for much, much higher welfare standards; and accelerated development and adoption of lab-grown meat.\n\nWhen it comes to domestic animals, it could potentially help maintaining better relationships and support those who deal with anxiety, though some people might stay ignorant and avoid the hard work that it comes to treat such reactions and behaviours. This potential for neglect mirrors a challenge in human interactions: despite our capacity for sophisticated communication, societal stigmas around mental health, personal biases, and a general reluctance to engage in difficult emotional labor  impede our ability to provide genuine support, even to those closest to us."

                        "question": "Which animals are we talking to?How might human society change if we developed a means of complex communication with:Sperm whales? (wild animals)Pigs? (farmed animals)Cats &amp; dogs? (domestic animals)",
                        "answer": "If we developed a means of complex communication with animals, not symbolic guesses or trained responses, but reciprocal dialogue. It would reshape the boundaries of advocacy, ethics, and power. But that transformation wouldn\u2019t be immediate or evenly distributed. It would be shaped by politics, profit, and whose voices society is willing to hear.\n\nWith wild species like sperm whales, such communication could lend weight to existing calls for personhood and habitat protection. Sperm whales already exhibit complex vocal patterns and social behavior. If we understood their communication in depth, it might validate decades of advocacy and reposition them not just as beings to conserve, but as agents with culture and memory. But whales are also charismatic megafauna where they are more likely to be heard than less visible or less \"media-friendly\" species. And as with many breakthroughs, the risk of co-option is real: tourism, novelty tech, or PR could reduce dialogue to entertainment without shifting the systems that endanger them.\n\nIn farmed animals like pigs, the stakes are higher and the barriers stronger. If pigs could articulate fear or suffering, it would pose a direct threat to industrial agriculture. Yet we\u2019ve seen how even robust evidence of animal sentience gets neutralized through delay, denial, or framing. Legal and policy systems are slow to respond, often deferring to economic interests. Still, animals speaking for themselves, even amid resistance could strengthen advocacy efforts by centering lived experience and undermining claims of human exceptionalism.\n\nWith cats and dogs, the shift would be more intimate but no less political. They\u2019re already seen as companions, but if they could express preferences or discomfort, our ideas of ownership, consent, and care would be challenged. It might change how custody, veterinary consent, and even product design are approached.\n\nUltimately, the question isn\u2019t just whether animals could speak and what they are saying, but whether human institutions are prepared to listen."

                        "answer": "1. Earlier detection of distress and pain\nStudies have already shown that ML models can be trained to recognize subtle signs of suffering across species. For instance, algorithms using pig vocalizations have been able to distinguish positive and negative emotional states with high accuracy (Briefer et al., 2022), while similar models applied to cats\u2019 facial expressions help detect silent pain (Evangelista et al., 2023). This means faster, more proactive care, especially in settings like farms and clinics where early signs are often missed.\n2. Recognition of animal preferences and autonomy\nTools like those being developed at Dalhousie University, which decode chicken vocalizations using natural language processing (Neethirajan, 2022), suggest we could start to respond to animals\u2019 own expressed needs, whether it\u2019s about discomfort, enrichment, or social grouping. \n3. Reduced stress in human-animal interactions\nUnderstanding what companion animals are actually trying to communicate could reduce misinterpretation-based stress\u2014like distinguishing a playful bark from anxiety. ML-driven tools have already shown potential here (Mihalcea et al., 2022), and could lead to better caregiving and fewer behavioral breakdowns or mislabelled aggression.\n4. Minimizing human-wildlife conflict\nML has helped decode not just whale codas but also bat calls and bee signals. In some cases, such as with robotic bees or guided bat calls (Landgraf et al., 2021), AI has even been used to \u201cspeak back\u201d to guide animals away from danger. This opens possibilities for low-intervention conflict mitigation that respects animal agency."

                        "answer": "1. If animals can be understood more precisely, their communication could be used not to empower them but to make them easier to manipulate. For example, farms might use stress signals to optimize productivity, not well-being. Adjusting conditions only to the point that animals remain efficient, not free from suffering. As with early surveillance tech in agriculture, this could entrench exploitation rather than challenge it.\n2. Language-like communication could be selectively recognized only in species seen as charismatic or commercially valuable. This risks reinforcing hierarchies within animal advocacy, where whales or primates gain rights, while chickens, fish, or insects, who may not express themselves in \u201ctranslatable\u201d ways remain excluded from welfare advances. The danger lies in making communication a prerequisite for moral concern.\n3. As Karen Bakker warns in The Sounds of Life, this can easily sideline welfare and habitat concerns. Misuse of communication tech could mean animals are constantly surveilled, prompted, or placed in unnatural scenarios that increase stress or disrupt natural behaviours.\n4. Poorly understood or clumsily implemented communication attempts could disrupt social or reproductive patterns in wild species. As Aza Raskin warns, we could end up launching a \u201cWhale QAnon\u201d, accidentally transmitting fear or misinformation into animal communities when attempting basic greetings. Even subtle miscommunication could alter migration, bonding, or threat response patterns.\n5. Granting animals a \u201cvoice\u201d through AI translation might lead to symbolic inclusion without structural change. Institutions might cite interspecies communication as a sign of progress while continuing harmful practices, much like how \u201chappy farm\u201d labels operate today."

For example, would communication with wildlife be similar to communication with isolated tribes? It could be that  we know and appreciate that it is possible for us to communicate with wildlife but it requires extra care if we don't want to harm them. It could be in a form of few selected (researchers?) people visiting and cautiously exchanging information. Maybe we could learn a lot about how reduce the devastating effects of climate change and establish mutually beneficial relationships.\nTalking to farm animals could be in some ways similar to talking to slaves in former times? Or even today, let's take the example of factory workers in the fashion industry. We could all theoretically talk to them. Company representatives can also talk to them in practice. Yet they are still exploited. The personal impact of going to the farm and talking to the animals there would most probably be transformative. But on a society level I am not so optimistic that anything would change.\nAnd for domestic animals, I wonder if it would be similar to talking to young children? I think the most benefits from complex communication could come in these relationships. Although there are also orphanages... So I don't know.\nI am afraid we would get used to it very quickly that we can communicate if we want to. It is likely though that consistently communicating constructively and respectfully would require at least as much effort as it does when talking to humans. Would we invest more energy into this than with our fellow humans?"

It could lead to mutual agreements on resource sharing and animals giving some of their \"products\" (egg, milk, feather, wool etc) in exchange for feed and shelter.\n- I can imagine the most benefits with companion animal communication. Often in these contexts we go above and beyond to try and communicate with pets.

Public attitude towards farmed animals would shift considerably if consumers are directly communicating with pigs, perhaps that would create less of a demand. Even producers and farmers would be more hesitant to directly or indirectly harm farmed animals.\n\nI think more people would want to have companion animals if they could talk to them, and be more attentive to their needs, but that could dramatically increase the demand for more, which could be positive as there are many strays to be adopted, who otherwise might not have the best life surviving on the streets.\n\nHowever, as the articles noted, we don't need AI or advanced communication to know the harms we are causing to animals and their desires for us to stop. I think the problem is the lack of empathy, of connection and respect, rigidity in institutions and human thinking in general."

This could lead to stronger global efforts to protect marine ecosystems, not just for human benefit, but as a moral obligation to sentient beings we now understand. It could also expand our sense of what it means to be intelligent and challenge our human centered worldview.\nPigs-If pigs could communicate complex thoughts and emotions, we might expect that it would lead to improved welfare or even an end to farming them, but realistically, many people might still excuse or ignore what pigs express. Even if pigs voiced fear, pain or boredom clearly, it\u2019s likely that society would rationalize it just as it already does with footage and evidence of their suffering. \nCats and dogs-Being able to communicate with cats and dogs would deepen our emotional bonds, clarify misunderstandings and potentially reduce behavioral problems. They might be able to express emotional states like anxiety or depression, helping us care for them better.

If they are already endangered, we risk endangering them further by confusing or misleading them with inaccurate communication. Also, interspecies communication technology could be misused to hunt or exploit wild animals. However, it would allow conservationists to better monitor populations, and it would allow animals to advocate for themselves and tell us about threats they face that we might not be aware of.\n\nBeing able to speak with farmed animals would be valuable because they could advocate for themselves, and it would inspire much more respect and empathy for them. While interspecies communication technology could potentially be used in factory farms, I don\u2019t think there would be any major risk in talking to farmed animals, since they are already enduring atrocious conditions. I think the increased empathy for farmed animals (and the potential to better represent their legal interests) would outweigh any detrimental uses in factory farms.\n\nI think talking to domestic animals would also be valuable, and makes the most sense since we interact with them the most. I similarly don\u2019t think there as many risks to this as there are to talking to wild animals, and it would provide several benefits: animals could communicate their needs to their humans more easily, sick animals could communicate their symptoms to veterinarians, they could give or refuse consent to medical procedures, and they could potentially even report abuse to a hotline if needed. My main concern with interspecies communication for domestic animals is that it could be used to force them to do more work for humans (for example, police dogs), but if we allow them to speak for themselves and represent their own interests, my hope is that it would make life better for them overall."

                        "answer": "Let's start by admitting that the premise is flawed. We won't be able to \"talk\" to other species by adding AI chat to their vocalizations; it will only happen after we respect the full, interconnected orchestra of signals they already use (chemical, tactile, visual, acoustic), most of which we barely perceive.\n\nSperm Whales\nTheir society is based on codas that we can register, but don't yet perceive. Unless we also pick up pressure pulses, visceral vibrations, and perhaps chemosensory signals that travel hundreds of meters underwater, any translator risks becoming a colonial loudspeaker. I doubt shipping companies will divert oil tankers just because an algorithm indicates the whales asked nicely; it's more likely that the data will be mined to track them \"efficiently.\"\n\nPigs\nGive a syntactical voice to an industrial pig and we'll hear talk of cramped pens, ammonia stings, and piglet cries, but will that change a trillion-dollar market? Without dismantling the profit-driven logic that brought it there, the new \"dialogue\" could be used to optimize growth curves, not to free bodies. We try to understand pigs talking when we ignore that they have needs as basic as sniffing.\n\nDogs and Cats\nWe already share homes with them, but most guardians never learn more than a few ear and tail cues. The chemical messages, so essential to canine life, are almost entirely ignored. If we skip the chores and switch to gadgets, we'll have flashy toys that translate barks into clich\u00e9s, failing to pick up on the pheromone essays dogs write on every lamppost. They've developed eyebrow muscles to communicate with us and a talent for following our visual cues; The least we can do is slow down and study their grammar before composing an interspecies WhatsApp message.\n\nSo, before fantasizing about whale speeches or pig Zoom calls, let's trade speed for depth: let's observe, smell, and understand how the world feels. I believe that for fair technological development, we must abandon the anthropocentric worldview. A science for animals must be built from the perspective of animals, not simply humans. Let's wait and let the animals set the agenda. Without that shift in perspective, any \"complex communication\" tool will only amplify our own voice, not theirs."

By interpreting which stimuli are pleasant or aversive, spaces, enrichment, and schedules are optimized to reduce boredom and frustration. AI could, for example, generate individualized enrichment plans for animal shelters.\n3. Individualized care. The ability to \"tell us\" about hunger, satiety, or digestive discomfort allows for tailored diets and treatments, improving health and longevity. They could alert us to unmet needs that we have overlooked.\n4. Perception of the individual. It could change society's view of nonhuman animals. Currently, there is a widespread view of nonhuman animals as either a resource to be exploited or a complement to be possessed. Giving animals a voice may serve to raise awareness that they are sentient individuals, with interests and a life of their own."

Knowing precisely what attracts a species can be used to force overexposure (e.g., shows) or increase intensive production, prioritizing profit over welfare.\n3. Loss of natural behaviors. If the entire environment is tailored to immediate comfort signals, animals could stop practicing behaviors essential to their physical and mental health (foraging, exploration, socialization). We can see this today in dogs.\n4. Data biases that make suffering invisible. Systems trained only with captive individuals may fail to detect problems in wild contexts, generating errors. For example, dominance theory in wolves (and dogs) emerged from the study of wolves in captivity and was disproved after studying packs in the wild. 5. Technological dependence and disinvestment in human care. Blindly trusting AI can reduce direct observation and the caregiver-animal bond, overlooking signals the system doesn't yet recognize."

Whales might directly express needs, potentially influencing international policy. However, we already understand many of their core needs (to not be hunted, stop polluting their environment etc.) so communication would serve more to reinforce their message than reveal new information. On the other hand, there is a significant risk of harm, as these are wild animals for a reason. In my view, human interference in this field should only occur when it directly supports their survival.\nPigs (farmed animals):\nIf pigs could express their suffering or preferences in words, it could radically challenge industrial farming. Society might finally begin to see pigs not as commodities but as sentient individuals, prompting ethical and legal shifts in food production. It could also compel governments to consider rights for non-human animals, closer to those afforded to humans. However, given pigs\u2019 economic role, the industry would likely resist and obstruct progress in this area of research.\nCats &amp; dogs (domestic animals):\nCommunication with pets could deepen their integration into family life and improve their care.

On the other hand, if wild animals have such different languages, world views, relationships, etc. that it's hard for humans to relate, I think this could further other non-human animals as well as just generally be underwhelming.\n- I think complex communication with farmed animals would allow more people to empathize with them and likely contribute to improvements in their living conditions. I doubt it would eliminate meat eating as a whole, but I think there would be a lot of energy towards reducing cruelty in factory farming. To eliminate meat eating, I think communication would have to show that farmed animals understand that they are being raised for slaughter and dread it-- i.e. that farmed animals have high levels of intelligence and consciousness. \n- I think that communication with domestic animals would not have as large societal impacts, but I do think a lot of pet owners would realize that their pets are actually not as happy as they think they are. Thus, likely most domestic animals would have more rich and fulfilling lives if they could directly communicate with their caretakers."

                        "answer": "1. Machine learning assisted interspecies communication may raise awareness as to what environments cause farmed animals the most distress. For example, Danish researchers collected over 15,000 sounds from pigs across farms in Denmark and Germany and were able to discern 19 noises pigs use to express emotions such as including happiness, sadness, fright, frustration and stress (https://www.thelocal.dk/20240904/danish-researchers-use-ai-to-understand-pigs). Pigs in indoor pens expressed more stress than pigs living outdoors. \n\n2. Machine learning assisted interspecies communication may allow veterinarians to better understand the needs of farmed and domesticated animals. Farmed animals do not receive the quality care that domesticated \"pet\" animals do, as veterinarians  are not tasked to treat farmed animals outside of keeping them alive toll the point of slaughter, and only if it's cost efficient. Veterinarians may not have been as engaged in learning farmed animal anatomy and physiology outside of a profit and or agriculture standpoint (i.e., their training wasn't as focused on improving the quality of life of a farmed animal, so they weren't as focused on identifying and treating cancers among farmed animals). However, ML assisted communication may allow veterinarians to explore new ways to improve the quality of life of farmed animals.   \n\n3. ML assisted interspecies communication may lead to the abolition of factor farming and animal agriculture as people increasingly see that other animals are more similar to them than different. People may no longer feel comfortable with exploiting human-like creatures. "

It is more obvious to me that communicating with pets and farmed animals makes a little more sense as they are largely scaffolded into human-centered environments. For domestic animals, having a means of linguistic-like communication might improve the well-being and quality of life for pets that we cohabitate with. I am less in favor of communicating directly with farmed animals that are being used for animal product purposes. In these cases, communication might cause a great deal of stress for the animal. However, if this is used as a means of advocacy for liberation, then I could see how this would make sense. For wild animals, I am less in favor of creating a clear channel for communication. These cultures are very old, and introducing new concepts to them might disturb and cause degradation of these societies. It seems in most cases, the benefits of clear communication between most animals and humans are a direct benefit to human societies as opposed to animal societies. Humans might be able to build more empathetic societal systems with the realization that consciousness and sentience are not unique only to us but to all living things."

I suppose our understanding of them might also be biased from most training data coming from living under human control, and thus the \"range\" of possible expressed needs and emotions being hard to compare to what a more fulfilling life might bring. These factors would probably sway the impact of animal communication towards \"little impact on animal exploitation\".\nFor wild animals, optimism could make more sense. A reason given to not help them or consider them morally is that we don't understand their genuine needs, hedonic experiences, or feelings toward human. If wild animal welfare researchers manage to improve animal communication, it might strengthen for antinatalist-leaning empathy for wild animals, in the way it currently exists for farmed animals in society (with many thinking that since farmed animals matter morally and suffer a lot, it's better to act in ways that causes them not to exist).\nA double-edged sword would be small animals. Since we might also \"decypher\" plant communication, it's likely that decyphering small animal's ways of communicating wouldn't give us that much information on what small animals are sentient. However, maybe there are insights on sentience we would get through this research that I can't anticipate from my perspective. But there are probably risks to tracking \"signals\" to get an idea of individual experiences."

Domesticated species such as dogs and cats are also being studied, largely through behavioral AI and vocal/emotional analysis.\n\nSperm whales (wild animals):\n1) Cultural impact: Recognizing whales as cultural beings could challenge human exceptionalism and fuel calls for legal personhood. Especially considering the time they have spent on Earth compared to us, they deserve our respect for that reason alone.\n2) Policy shifts: Documented whale complaints (i.e., about ocean noise) could strengthen environmental regulations and conservation laws.\n3) Ethical rethinking: It may shift us from managing whales as wildlife to engaging with them as sentient stakeholders in ocean governance. This carries a significant risk of a potential 'ontological shock' on a massive scale, and I don't believe humans are prepared for it.\n\nPigs (farmed animals)\n1) Moral reckoning: If pigs can express suffering, preferences, or even protest, factory farming becomes ethically indefensible to many.\n2) Legal and industry reform: It could drive stronger animal welfare laws, better housing conditions, and accelerate the shift toward plant-based or cultivated alternatives.\n3) Consumer behavior: Clear communication from pigs could deeply influence public sentiment, making animal agriculture less socially acceptable.\n\nCats and dogs (domestic animals)\n1) Strengthened bonds: Deeper understanding of emotions and needs could lead to better care, and welfare.\n2) New responsibilities: Recognizing their autonomy could raise ethical questions about breeding, confinement, and euthanasia, among others.\n3) Therapeutic and social roles: Enhanced communication could expand their roles in mental health, elder care, and even collaborative AI systems (hopefully)"

Their wisdom could humble humanity, exposing the illusion of progress and inspiring a shift from domination to coexistence. Environmental policy would be forced to include their voices, turning these giants into witnesses of ecological harm and advocates for planetary stewardship.\n\nPigs, often reduced to products in factory farms, could express their emotional depth and suffering, leading to moral outrage and the collapse of industrial animal agriculture. As sentient communicators, they might resist captivity, share their knowledge, and catalyse shifts in diet, ethics, and human-animal relationships. Domestication itself might be reconsidered, giving rise to new forms of interspecies interaction.\n\nCats and dogs, long-standing human companions, would become emotional partners, advisors, and even political actors.

Their enhanced roles may include helping mediate between wild species and humans, ushering in multi-species governance.\n\nThese shifts would expand our moral circle, reshape laws, and influence infrastructure development.

Some may choose to ignore or suppress animal voices rather than act ethically.\n\n3. Unequal voice among species\n   Species with more advanced or easier-to-translate communication (e.g., dogs) may receive more attention and protection than others (e.g., insects or reptiles), creating new hierarchies and neglecting less \"communicative\" animals.\n\n4. Increased justification for control or surveillance**\n   Communication technologies could be used to monitor and control animal behaviour more strictly, under the guise of \"understanding\" them, limiting freedom rather than enhancing welfare.\n"

Yet, there\u2019s a risk of disrupting their social structures or enabling manipulation. History shows language can justify exploitation, like how vegan ethics struggle when \u201cconsent\u201d is interpreted by humans, or how treaties and corporate claims exploit words for profit. Could whales be coerced to change migration or assist human activities? Before engaging, we must ensure we communicate responsibly, avoiding turning connection into control or harm. Caution and further research are essential before initiating dialogue. \n\n2. AI-powered communication with pigs could expose their emotional complexity, challenging how we justify farming them. While this might shift public perception-seeing pigs as sentient individuals rather than food, it also risks being co-opted to optimize production under the guise of welfare. Precision livestock farming may improve monitoring, but often reinforces exploitation. Whether this leads to ethical reform or deeper entrenchment depends on our willingness to act on what pigs express. Real change would require rethinking animals not as commodities, but as beings with rights\u2014prompting society to redefine progress and confront the moral costs of factory farming.\n3. If we could speak with cats and dogs, it would likely deepen already strong emotional bonds and challenge the legal view of pets as property. Language could enhance care and respect, but also raise complex questions around autonomy\u2014like consent to neutering or medical procedures. Would pets be treated like children, with humans making decisions \u201cfor their own good,\u201d or gain more direct agency? Communication might also reshape how animals see their relationship with us, potentially redefining ownership as partnership. It could prompt legal and ethical shifts, pushing society to treat domestic animals less as dependents and more as sentient individuals."

It would be harder to ignore their autonomy once their voices are literally heard.\nImproved Veterinary Care \u2013 Domestic animals could signal pain, fear, or confusion before symptoms become obvious. This would allow for earlier interventions and more humane treatment, improving quality of life.\nRedefining Ownership \u2013 Language could transform pet ownership into ethical partnership. It would raise important questions about consent in procedures like neutering or behavioral control, potentially reshaping legal and social norms.\nEthical Conservation \u2013 Wild animals could directly inform us about ecological stressors, making conservation more responsive.

Or, we could provide dubious incentives to displace and exploit whales from/on their habitats (much like it was done with indigenous populations and people turned slaves the colonial and post-colonial periods --and continually to this date in some cases). Less maliciously, there could still be miscommunications that cause confusion and disruptions for whales.\n\nPigs/farmed animals\nImproved communication could be used in utilitarian ways, to ensure compliance with farm protocols and even exploit or create problematic social hierarchies.\n\nCats and dogs\nGiven the relative preferential status of cats and dogs in (Western) society, I am a little less pessimistic about this outlook. However, many people relate to cats, dogs, and other domestic animals thanks to the psychological projections they make of their own feelings.

Humans find it harder to relate to species with whom they believe they have less in common or whose behavior seems more obscure to them. Through improve communication, these behaviors can be illuminated, and empathy can begin to develop.\n\n3. More compassionate and diverse methods to develop the fields and animal science, including phenomenological approaches that value the personal experiences of non-human animals.\n\n4. Development of ethical frameworks for interspecies interaction. Thanks in part to the point above, the better understanding about the needs and desires of different species would allow us to incorporate them more\n\n5. Proactive legal (e.g., territorial reclaiming and rules for engagement) efforts to delineate the rights of non-human animals. This would extend beyond remediation measures discussed in the first point, to include measures to improve the quality of life of animals and ensure that they have an enriching environment."

                        "answer": "1. Exploitation of animals by poachers, governments, turism enterprises. If commmunication improves without parallel development of ethical frameworks, policy and legal frameworks, and above all an improved legal status for animals, further instrumentalization of animals is certain to increase (at least until these other points can catch up). For example, governments might \"persuade\" marine animals to yield or \"share\" resources that have been ear-marked for development, mining, or other operations. Because they could now claim that this was done \"in collaboration\" with these animals, in this instance improved communication might detract from the efforts of activists and scientists trying to protect the wellbeing of animals.\n\n2. Unequal development of empathy which further marginalizes some species in favor of a few others. As mentioned above, humans tend to more readily empathize with those who are most similar to them. If improved communication with animals highlights these similarities for some species while emphasizing differences for others, this might lead to a reduced moral status for the latter. Specifically, they might be perceived as lesser species, given a heuristic association of our version of social organization and communication with the level of personhood of a species. \n\n3. There are likely to be negative outcomes in the short-term due to growing pains of fine tuning these technologies. These will take the form of misunderstandings between humans and other species. Just as early NLP algorithms failed to grasp the complexity of human language, so might be the case in trying to capture the complexity of interactions in other species.\n\n4. Related to the point above, because ML will carry the bias of human developers, it is possible that our understanding of other species is always incomplete. Due to overconfidence, we might fail to recognize this possibility and enact decisions based on the output of the algorithm that are inconsistent with the desires of species and which ultimately degrade their quality of life.\n\n5. We might inadvertedly become overly intrusive to animals, as we continue to seek further interactions with them and might unwillingly be coercing them to participate."

Perhaps they could help humans with the sadness and decision of humane euthanasia- telling us they were ready, or that they weren't.   Interpreting domestic animal communication could help in animal abuse cases- and maybe close down dog fighting rings (or conversely, finding out what dogs enjoy fighting).  If we truly understood how animals communicate, perhaps animals could help in domestic violence cases or other crimes. Communication with dogs that were trained to find people or cadavers would be really helpful, as well as communication with military or police dogs. But dogs trained for dangerous or violent tasks, like military or police dogs, might protest or be more exploited. \n\nCommunicating with factory-farmed animals seems like it would only bring more positive outcomes to the animals. If we knew animals were scared, uncomfortable, tortured, and more, wouldn't more people tend to eat fewer animals? We might eat more protein from animals with less advanced brain function, like worms or bugs, which have their own ethical considerations.  Pigs are known to be very intelligent, so communicating with them may change the entire factory farming industry. However, as humans, we have ignored the suffering of indigenous peoples when we could communicate with them, and we enslaved humans whom we could communicate with. We might just ignore what animals say. \n\nLast, communicating with wild animals could help them and also harm them.

It might reshape our ethical and legal systems, influence our daily lives, and even impact various industries. This kind of interaction could lead to a radical reevaluation of our relationship with wild animals and the natural world as a whole.\nInitiatives like Project CETI and Earth Species Project are specifically focused on developing complex communication with sperm whales. Our current understanding of cetacean communication isn't enough to fully protect them from human-caused harms like captivity, pollution, and vessel strikes. Deeper insights into their behavior, suffering, and interactions would become available if we could understand their language.\nHowever, there are serious risks involved. This technology could be misused by unethical individuals for hunting, luring, or exploiting whales. There's also the danger of attempting to communicate with whales before fully grasping their language, potentially sending stark warnings when intending greetings, or disrupting their vital mating and migration patterns."

What if all these animals express very simple desires and emotions relating to sleeping, eating, and breeding? Would we be more willing to eat livestock animals?

It would mark a linguistic breakthrough, expanding our understanding of non-human intelligence while challenging speciesism. AI could improve marine veterinary care, helping diagnose whale health issues and protect food sources. Additionally, this could lead to discussions about legal representation for animals. Most importantly, these advancements may deepen the human-animal connection, promoting ethical coexistence.\nPigs\nSimilar changes could occur with pigs, but with distinct advantages. Pigs are easier to communicate with than whales, as many already form relationships with humans in sanctuaries or as pets. AI could enhance pig welfare, reinforcing ethical eating by proving their suffering in factory farms.

                        "answer": "Sperm Whales:\nI would  hope that this would lead to a reduction in wild animal welfare but I'm sceptical that is what would actually be the result. I suspect that wild animal communication would lead to a decrease in animal welfare in the short term as it is likely that we won't be aware of the impacts that our communication will have on animal societies. Understanding the complex interactions caused by our interactions is extremely difficult. Additionally there is a lot of space for abuse of such communication by manipulating animals. Animals could be manipulated to leave habitats for the benefit of environmental approvals, animals could be misquoted or misunderstood for supporting specific view points rather than bettering animal welfare.\n\nFarmed animals:\nI'm more hopeful when it comes to farmed animals. These animals already have challenging life experiences. As farmers begin to hear animal preferences and animal liberation groups communicate animal preferences I suspect demand and supply of animal products will decrease. There is a chance that farmers will also improve animal welfare or meet the preferences of animals more often. Although there will likely be push back and claims that animals are so unlike humans that they don't deserve better treatment I suspect legislation would be passed to help improve the lives of farmed animals. Additionally if veterinarians were able to communicate or at least understand animals we'd likely see healthcare outcomes improve.\n\nDomesticated animals:\nI believe that this would likely be a negative overall. Despite domesticated animals probably getting better healthcare and preference fulfillment I expect there would be a surge of increased domesticated animal population. As we currently see many animals are taken in despite the carer's ability to care for them. The novelty of communicating with domesticated animals is likely to push up demand. Then with these animals communicating their needs and preferences regularly and clearly I expect at least the same percentage will be abandoned or abused. Domesticated animal welfare isn't great but I don't see the benefits outweighing the negatives."

                        "answer": "1. Improved understanding of human impacts on animal's environments and lives could be obtained from animals providing their understanding and observations. These additional data points could open unconsidered avenues for research or contextualise decisions.\n\n2. Some people may relate more to animals as they see that animals are more complex and social than they thought. Potentially this could lead to more people considering animal welfare in human decisions. As people hear stories of farmed animals preferences or just the ability to communicate more people may reduce their reliance on animal products. \n\n3. An odd impact may be that we could see more detailed and accurate decisions by ethics boards in animal research. As animals are able to communicate preferences and their experiences  we may see research in fields using animal models could decrease the number of required animals and increase reliability of research results.\n\n4. We may see that animals that are injured or in captivity could be treated better as they are able to communicate their needs effectively."

                        "answer": "1.  It is possible that by improving interspecies communication animal welfare could be negatively impacted by unintended side affects and second order consequences. If we don't consider that our communication may cause animals to act in unintended ways we could see increased animal suffering, especially in  wild animals.\n\n2. Another possibility is that the use of animal products increases due to a perception that farmed animal's preferences are better met. People currently justify to themselves the consumption of animal products despite current evidence of suffering. By communicating with farmed animals additional green washing may allow greater self-justification of farming animals no matter if the animals needs are met or not.\n\n3. At least in the shorter term we may see an increase in the number of animals being used in research. Research animals generally live a highly controlled life that, despite ethics committees, can be high in suffering. A new capability in communicating with animals is likely to see a big surge in new research all requiring animals and subjecting them to lives of suffering and control."

I fear that developing a means of complex communication with whales or other wild animals would lead to abuse of that knowledge and human interference with their ways of life, up to and including more slaughter.  On the other hand, people were captivated decades ago when whale songs were recorded and distributed and a movement did form to save the whales.\n\nFarmed Animals\nIn terms of numbers, farmed animals suffer the most abuse in the modern world.  They're not charismatic megafauna like whales and they're not (mostly) considered to be cute, so they're neglected and abused.  Animal farms have virtually no legal restrictions and some places even allow what any sane person would consider to be abuse to exist as long as that particular practice has been done historically and traditionally.  As with precision livestock farming, where technology could be used to help animals, the question remains whether it will be used to that effect or just used to increase the profitability of the farms.  If humans will ignore sensors and cameras that indicate an animal is suffering physically and/or psychologically, they would certainly do the same if they received that same information via a means of interspecies communication.\n\nDomestic Animals\nOf the three categories of animals here, domestic animals seems to be the one that would have the most potential to benefit from a human-developed method of interspecies communication.  Many people treat their cats and dogs and other companion animals as members of their families and would do anything for them.  Perhaps if we learned to understand what they are telling us, we would realize that farmed animals and wildlife have similar needs and emotions.\n\n\n"

Identify illnesses more quickly and deal with the problems promptly, thereby keeping the animals healthy and decreasing the preventive use of antibiotics.\n4. Improve adoption rates at companion animal shelters by identifying which cats and dogs are only scared because of their environment and would become calm and friendly in a home environment.  Improve the retention rate for new adoptions by learning exactly what the new animals need and want immediately instead of losing patience and returning the animals to the shelters.\n5. Improve veterinary telemedicine, particularly for pet parents who have currently- or formerly-feral cats who refuse to be touched.  Capturing their needs via interspecies communication would mean less stress on the animals, their pet parents, and their vets.\n\n\n"

Enriched Living Environments\nBy understanding animals\u2019 preferences\u2014e.g. what activities, companions, or environments they enjoy\u2014caretakers can design enrichment and housing that promote psychological well-being, not just survival.\n\n3. Consent and Autonomy in Care\nAnimals could be given more control over grooming, handling, or medical procedures by signaling readiness or refusal. This respects their agency and minimizes stress.\n\n4. Stronger Legal and Ethical Recognition\nClear communication may make it harder to ignore animal interests. If animals can express desires or suffering in \u201chuman-legible\u201d terms, they\u2019re more likely to gain legal protections.\n\n5.

Longtermism is the ethical view that positively influencing the long-term future is a key moral priority. It emphasizes actions that can safeguard or improve the well-being of future generations\u2014including humans and potentially nonhuman animals.\nRelation to Animal Welfare: Longtermism highlights the need to consider not only immediate suffering but also systemic changes that could impact animals over millennia\u2014such as ending factory farming or designing AI systems aligned with animal welfare.\nPotential Tensions: Longtermist priorities often focus on reducing existential risks, which may deprioritize pressing but less catastrophic issues like animal suffering. There's also the risk that an overly anthropocentric future could scale animal exploitation (e.g., in colonized planets).\n\n2. Value Lock-In refers to the risk that powerful future technologies\u2014especially AGI\u2014will entrench current moral values (e.g., speciesism) in ways that become difficult to reverse.\nRelation to Animal Welfare: If AGI systems are aligned only with current human preferences, they may exclude or perpetuate harm toward animals. Locking in animal-positive values could ensure long-lasting protection.\nPotential Tensions: There\u2019s a strategic trade-off between accelerating AGI development and ensuring time for inclusive moral reflection. Misaligned lock-in could entrench factory farming or overlook wild animal suffering.\n\n3. Moral Circle Expansion (MCE) is the process of extending moral concern to a broader range of beings\u2014such as animals, digital minds, or future sentient life.\nRelation to Animal Welfare: MCE directly supports animal advocacy by challenging speciesism and promoting a culture of compassion toward all sentient beings.\nPotential Tensions: Prioritizing MCE might draw resources from existential risk work, and radical shifts in advocacy (e.g., demanding equal rights for invertebrates) could provoke backlash, slowing moral progress."

In relation to animals, longtermism urges us to consider not only the suffering of animals today but also the lives of future farmed animals, wild animals, and even potential digital minds. However, this long-term focus can create tension by deprioritizing immediate action for animals now. If resources are concentrated on speculative risks like artificial intelligence, urgent reforms for real, suffering animals today may be neglected.\n\nValue lock-in refers to the possibility that certain moral values could become permanently embedded into institutions or artificial intelligence systems. If compassion for animals becomes locked in, it could ensure animal-friendly outcomes far into the future. But if current values that ignore or exploit animals are embedded, this could lead to a future where animal suffering is permanently overlooked. There is a tension here between acting quickly to influence systems like AI and taking time to improve values through broader social change. A rushed lock-in of incomplete or harmful ethics could harm animals irreversibly.\n\nMoral circle expansion is the process of including more beings within our moral concern. Expanding this circle to animals can lead to better laws, food choices, and ethical frameworks that protect them. In the long term, this can shape cultures and technologies to respect all sentient life. However, expanding the moral circle brings trade-offs. Advocating for animals may conflict with economic interests or cultural traditions. Also, as we include more beings like future digital minds or wild animals, it becomes harder to decide how to balance all these interests fairly. There is a risk that focusing on abstract or distant beings could dilute attention from those suffering right now."

Food technology becomes cheap, tasty, and widely available. Societies globally adopt stronger moral concern for animals, recognizing their sentience and suffering. Politically, laws are passed banning factory farming and supporting alternatives. This shift is helped by education, activism, and global coordination. The outcome is a world where billions of animals no longer suffer and ecosystems recover.\n\nNegative future\nFactory farming becomes more intense and widespread. Technological tools such as genetic engineering and AI are used to increase productivity at the expense of animal welfare. Governments continue to subsidize animal agriculture while ignoring ethical concerns. Moral attitudes toward animals remain speciesist or indifferent. Political systems prioritize food security and economic growth over welfare. In this scenario, suffering scales up even further as more animals are farmed more efficiently, but in worse conditions.\n\nNeutral future\nFarming practices improve slightly with modest welfare reforms like more space or pain relief, but animal use continues. Cultivated meat and plant-based alternatives grow slowly but never fully replace traditional farming. Morally, some people care about animals but not enough to drive major changes. Politically, reforms stall due to lobbying and consumer resistance. In this future, animals continue to live in compromised conditions. Suffering remains widespread, but there is no sharp increase or full-scale shift.\n\n"

The tension: longtermism may lead us to prioritising speculative long-term goals ahead of current animal suffering.\n\nExistential risks (X-risks) are disasters (like pandemics or AI takeover) that could end humanity\u2019s potential (or at least, it's mostly discussed wiz. humanity) forever, e.g. by wiping us out.  There are a few ways in which this can interact with animal welfare: First, we can think of x-risk where only humanity (but not non-human animals) go extinct. The effect of this on animals depends on what effect we would have had in the future, if not going extinct. Second, we can think of events that cause animals to go extinct too. The moral value of these happenings depend on how good or bad the lives animals would have had in the future.

Technologically, incremental vet advancements occur, but widespread, transformative shifts are absent; cultured meat remains niche. Morally, conflicting views on animal sentience persist; \"humane\" labels offer comfort but don't challenge fundamental animal use. Politically, animal welfare laws vary greatly by region, and constant lobbying battles between animal advocates and industries lead to little significant change.

Usually this is solely applied to humans, but one (important) view is that this should be increasingly applied towards non-human animals. Of course, since most humans on this earth are speciesist, we can expect that there will be much resistance towards incorporating the view of non-human animals into value alignment for AI systems, as many people just won't care.\n\nValue lock-in is when a certain set of values become persistent and are either difficult or impossible to change. For example, if speciesism as a value becomes \"locked-in\" for humans, and we become incredibly resistant or negligent to changing our view on animals. This would be a problem, as if most of the human population is speciesist, this would mean our resultant AI systems would reflect that value of speciesism, and spread that value far into the future and possibly on other worlds.\n\nMoral circle expansion is the idea that we should be expanding our circle of morals to other beings, not just humans. For example, this would include farmed animals, wild animals, insects, and digital sentient minds. Obviously, this would affect animals as their welfare would be part of that expansion. This could definitely affect how animals are treated and perceived in the long-term future as this would require us to determine if we consider non-human animals to be part of our expanding moral circle. This in turn would determine whether we factor them into the value alignment for our AI systems."

From a tech standpoint, if more alternative proteins were developed that drove the demand down for meat, this could also help.\nIn the same way, if all these efforts went in the opposite direction, where speciesism reigned supreme, no legislature was passed at all (or legislature passed negatively affected animals) and alternative proteins / cultured meat demand is low or nonexistent, then farmed animal lives could be horrible. Of course, there is a middle ground as well.

It pushes us to ask not only how we shape the far future, but whose well-being we prioritize within it. How, then, do we push for long-term goals and well being of non-humans in reduction of their suffering?\n\nValue lock-in refers to a moment when certain moral priorities or structures become entrenched, shaping all future trajectories. The norms and priorities we set today, especially within AI systems, could entrench anthropocentric biases for centuries or more. But here\u2019s where I sense real tension: much of the current AI safety and alignment work is framed around protecting human existence, sometimes treating animal interests as secondary or optional or finding longer steps in using non-human animals for more of human interests.\n\nMoral circle expansion urges us to broaden ethical concern to animals, but I wonder: when trade-offs emerge, whose interests take precedence? How do we navigate situations where interventions that reduce X-risk for humans might perpetuate systemic harms to animals? These tensions feel central to shaping effective advocacy. Balancing these interests is not straightforward , and so we need to ask not just who survives but whose flourishing counts in the futures we are building."

This is supported by breakthroughs in biotechnology, food system innovation, and AI systems that are aligned with inclusive moral values. These AI systems help optimize for sustainability and ethical outcomes, not just economic efficiency. Societies expand their moral circle to include nonhuman animals, embedding animal welfare into law, public norms, and global governance. Key actors such as international regulatory bodies, consumer movements, and advocacy coalitions work together to phase out industrial animal farming. Surviving populations of farmed animals are cared for in sanctuaries or rewilded where possible.\n\nIn a negative future, industrial farming intensifies under mounting economic pressures, especially in low and middle-income countries where demand for animal products rises. Biotechnological tools like CRISPR and gene editing are used primarily to increase productivity, for example by reducing animals\u2019 capacity to feel pain or stress, rather than addressing the ethics of their use. AI systems are deployed to optimize agricultural efficiency in ways that reinforce human-centered goals, without integrating moral concern for animals. Policymakers, prioritizing trade competitiveness and food security, deprioritize animal welfare. This locks in speciesist priorities at a structural and global level.\n\nIn a neutral or mixed future, some welfare reforms are achieved, such as the spread of cage-free systems or modest environmental enrichments, but factory farming remains the global norm. Alternative proteins see strong uptake in certain regions, but cultural, economic, and political barriers prevent widespread global transition. Global governance mechanisms struggle to harmonize standards, leaving fragmented progress. AI technologies play a mixed role, supporting ethical improvements in some regions while reinforcing efficiency-driven, status quo systems in others.\nThinking about, and describing these scenarios raises the broader question of how we balance urgent human concerns with the long-term flourishing of nonhuman lives, and how we structure advocacy efforts to reflect that balance."

Extension of moral/ethical considerations towards other beings, in the case of non-human animals usually based on their sentience capacity.\n2. This is the main goal of anti-speciesism: inclusion of non-human animals into the moral circle.\n3. There might be a tension within the animal welfare movement to include wild animals into the moral circle as well given the strong tendencies towards the naturalistic fallacy within the movement. Some people might argue that before expanding our moral circle towards non-human animals, we should prioritise the full implementation of the expansion to other human beings based on their ethnicity, gender identity, etc.\n\nValue lock-in\n1. The is the risk that existing sets of values/beliefs in society stay unchanged/\"locked in\", increasing the likelihood of ethically wrong actions continuing over several generations or even spreading with humanity itself, such as speciesism.\n2. Value lock-in of humanity's speciesism should be the biggest fear of the animal welfare movement. This would be stagnation of humanity's process of moral expansion since the 18th century.\n3. Fast AI development is certainly increasing the likelihood of the expansion of human civilisation into outer space with the existing set of moral/ethical beliefs to that point in time and thus risking the expansion of speciesist behavioural practices, such as the abuse of non-human animals.\n\nLongtermism\n1. It is the belief that the preferences of individuals in the (far) future should matter as much as those of individuals existing today, equivalent to the irrelevance of geographical location for ethical erlev.\n2. This implies that the animal welfare movement should at least also be considering if not even prioritising improving the lives of future non-human animals.\n3. Some longtermists argue that non-human animals should not be taken into consideration when it comes to longtermism as their ultimate goal is human flourishing. For them caring about the well-being of non-human animals doesn't have a positive direct effect on human civilisation and is thus a waste of resources. Within the animal welfare movement, the longtermism perspective should also lead us to consider potential long-term risks our actions might have, e.g. GMO."

However, if we manage to end speciesism, animal welfare values will be the norm and will be expanded to other planets.\n- Due to human interests, it isn't easy for speciesism to end.

Many more wild animals will go extinct due to poaching, hunting, destruction of habitats, especially with perpetrators abusing AI to harm animals on a large scale or the indirect harms of AI being used to drive further human domination and industrialization that destroys nature and displaces wild animals. Billions if not trillions of animals will suffer and even die prematurely, with millions of species going extinct without the environments to support them. Politics that enable this scenario is likely to be authoritarian and ultra capitalistic. \n\n3.

While this \u201cbest possible future\u201d is generally considered to be the best for human flourishing, it can (like most branches of moral philosophy) certainly apply to all species. If we believe nonhuman animals deserve moral consideration because they are sentient, and that future humans deserve moral consideration because they will be sentient, then it would make sense to afford similar consideration to future nonhuman animals. A major tension here is that traditional views of human flourishing often entail immense animal suffering (for example, meat consumption).\n\nValue lock-in is a situation in which values become so deeply ingrained in society that they become difficult or impossible to change. This is an important concern for animal-rights advocates, because creating a just future requires ensuring that speciesist values are not locked in. I think that AI has the potential to exacerbate value lock-in, since AI systems will be trained based on humans\u2019 current value systems and are unlikely to change their values on their own (unless they gain consciousness). As AI increasingly influences how humans think, this could lead humans to reconsider their values less than before; since animal rights is not currently mainstream, I am concerned that this could lead to speciesist value lock-in. However, one tension is that it may not be in AI developers\u2019 interests to incorporate animal welfare into AI safety considerations because it would be at odds with how they live their lives.\n\nMoral circle expansion refers to giving moral consideration to more and more categories of beings. Over time, the moral circle has been expanding to give equal rights to more groups of humans; now, it can expand to consider nonhuman animals as similarly worthy of respect. In the future, it could expand even further to consider the interests of artificial intelligence and of plants and fungi. This would inherently lead to a vast increase in moral dilemmas on a daily basis, which I think many humans would like to avoid.

In this future, we would be able to share our technological and medical advances to improve their lives. We would use interspecies communication to better share these advances and to moderate conflicts. Humans would no longer kill or exploit wild animals, thinking of them more as neighbors, and we would become part of a thriving and just ecological community. I believe the biggest factor here is societal norms; none of these positive things would happen (except perhaps averting climate change) under speciesist value lock-in. Sharing medical interventions with wild animals, and using interspecies communication for positive ends, require humans to collectively decide that we want the best for all species, not just ours. Enshrining animal rights in the law, as well as AI standards and other aspects of society, would help this moral shift to happen.\n\nIn the worst long-term future for wild animals, we would experience speciesist value lock-in, perpetuated by AI that has been trained to exclusively help humans. Humans would continue to deplete the environment, leading to even greater mass extinction, and only interact with wild animals to exploit them. Other forms of animal suffering, such as starvation, would also increase as a result of climate change and habitat destruction. If speciesist values become entrenched, that would make such exploitation much more likely. Additionally, if political leaders continue to disregard the long-term future, climate change will go unchecked, leading to a much worse future for everyone.\n\nA neutral future would also be possible. If AI technologies give wild animals the basic moral consideration that most humans currently do (i.e. that harming them for no reason is bad) and encourage generally positive treatment without any major cultural shifts, and that remains the societal norm, wild animals would largely be left to their own devices, with some negative effects from climate change.

For animals, this might mean preventing huge amounts of suffering in the future, whether it\u2019s farmed animals, wild animals, or even digital beings that might feel pain. But longtermism often focuses on things like AI, which doesn\u2019t always connect to helping animals right now. That creates tension with people working on more urgent stuff like factory farming. Some think we can do both- reduce suffering now while also working toward a better future.\n\nValue lock-in is when certain values get really hard to change over time, especially as powerful systems like AI start influencing how things go. If society doesn\u2019t prioritize animals now, we risk locking in a future where their suffering is ignored for a very long time. For example, if AI is trained to care only about humans, animals might never matter in the system. That\u2019s a big risk, but there\u2019s still a chance to shape things. Getting more people to care about animals today could help protect them long-term. Some worry this focus feels too abstract and pulls attention away from more tangible work like ending factory farming.\n\nMoral circle expansion is the idea that, over time, more beings get included in our sense of who matters. People used to care mostly about their own group, then gradually extended concern to all humans. The next step is thinking about animals, future generations, and maybe even digital minds. For animals, this means more people realizing they can suffer and taking steps to help. Some worry animals might get skipped over as attention shifts to far-off future beings, but expanding the circle still feels like a hopeful direction."

What happens today could affect billions, or even trillions, of lives so it's essential to consider how our actions shape the long-term future.\nIn animal welfare, this could mean caring about the future of animals, too. For example, will factory farming continue to grow, or will we shift to alternatives? Could new technologies, such as AI, ultimately help or harm animals? Longtermism pushes us to think about these big-picture, long-term questions.\nBut there are tensions. Some people think we should focus primarily on preventing human extinction (such as with AI safety), which might mean less emphasis on helping animals today. Others worry we might care too much about future humans and not enough about future animals\u2014or even digital minds. It's a balancing act.\nLong-termism and animal welfare can work together, but we must ensure that animals remain part of the conversation.\n\n\nValue lock-in occurs when certain ideas or moral values become \"locked in\" by powerful systems, such as governments, technology, or AI, and persist for a long time, even if they're not the most effective ones.\nThis really matters for animals. If the world \"locks in\" values that don't care much about animals, we could end up with a future where factory farming or animal suffering keeps happening for centuries. But if we lock in values that care about all sentient beings, we could build a better, more compassionate future.\nThe tension is that value lock-in could go either way. Some people might want to lock in human-centered values, focusing only on things like human progress or survival. That could leave animals out of the picture. So, we need to be careful about which values get locked in, and make sure animal welfare is part of the future we're building."

A value lock-in that disfavors the interests of animals will perpetuate animal suffering over long-term time-horizons.

If particular animals species are not included in the category of beings that deserve moral consideration, then they are seen simply as objects, and their interests and welfare do not matter in their own right (they can still matter instrumentally, if they serve the interests of some other beings who are given moral consideration).

Animals have typically been left out of this type of thought or scholarship because of the focus on prolonging and extending the human species. The materials presented this week aim to recenter long-termism to also include animals. However, the considerations for animals and humans are still different in this regard, as the authors primarily have framed some cases, like wild animal behaviors, as something that inherently causes suffering in some animals and not others. While I believe that reducing suffering is in principle a good idea, some of the authors suggest not recolonizing other plants with wild animals because it perpetuates suffering in some animals and not in others (e.g., predator, prey). This has a lot of paternalism in it to me, and I think our role in this process is to act as stewards of preservation, not dictators of what should be preserved.\n\nExistential risk: From the materials this week, I would define existential risk as a type of risk that could lead to a permanent state change within a state of existence for either people or other animals. In terms of animal welfare, existential risk is dependent on whether humans choose to include them within an adopted framework of long-termism. Some humans might have a difficult time redirecting short-term efforts to alleviate suffering in animals to more intergenerational societal shifts when we currently aren't also able to provide basic needs for most humans.\n\nMoral circle expansion: Moral circle expansion would include stepping outside of moral structures that are speciesist and including other species within consideration of moral frameworks. This could include understanding morality in other animals and considering animals as moral agents in human-centered environments. Without research unifying what morality looks like in other animals, this will be a challenge to get humans to decenter themselves to recognize animal morality."

There are uncertainties there: if humans are disempowered but decision makers remain, these decision makers could choose to help wild animals, or preserve some forms of farming. Nonetheless, it seems humans are more likely to be compassionate than other decision making systems (and perhaps than future evolved animals), and also much more likely to want animal farming to continue, making it very likely that long-term futures containing factory farming or wild animal welfare interventions are strongly correlated with human-controlled future (though in the long term, we could easily imagine humans not desiring for slaughterhouses to continue existing, and even some larger scale wild animal intervention than what is seen today). Nonetheless, I think it is likely that the future of life on earth will not be controlled by intelligent decision makers (this seems disjunctive), so  longtermists should better assess how much better or worse we should expect a world only containing wild animals to be."

It asks us to care not only about those suffering now but also about the many lives that could exist in the future. When it comes to animal welfare, longtermism encourages us to think bigger: how can we create a future where animals no longer suffer at scale, where humanity does less wrongs? That could mean investing in alternatives to factory farming, better laws, or new technologies.\nBut there are trade-offs. For instance, should we focus on helping animals now or invest in big changes that take years to pay off? Can we ensure AI systems of the future care about animals too, or will they only follow human priorities? \n\nExistential risks (X-risks) are threats that could destroy humanity or permanently limit our potential, such as climate collapse, nuclear war, or unaligned artificial intelligence. These risks matter deeply for animal welfare because they threaten not only human survival but also the future of countless animal species and ecosystems. If humanity perishes, so does our capacity to protect and improve animal lives. However, if we survive without moral progress, we risk entrenching harmful systems like industrial animal farming on an even larger scale.\nThere are tensions to navigate. Efforts to prevent X-risks may prioritize human survival at the expense of current animal suffering. AI alignment focused solely on human values could ignore or harm non-human animals. Resource allocation can also be a challenge; investing in long-term safety might reduce focus on immediate welfare interventions.\n\nMoral circle expansion is the growing recognition that more beings, beyond just humans, deserve moral consideration. In animal welfare, this means acknowledging animals as sentient and worthy of protection. It supports efforts to reduce suffering, end factory farming, and embed animal interests into laws and technology.

One where their lives go very well\nImagine a world where animals like Luna the cow and Rufus the pig live lives filled with kindness and understanding. Luna talks gently with her caregiver through a special device that shares her feelings, while Rufus happily signals when he wants a dust bath, knowing someone will listen. Gone are the days of cramped factory farms; now, animals live on smaller, compassionate farms where technology helps ensure they stay healthy, happy, and free to express themselves. Animals aren\u2019t just property, they have voices and advocates who stand up for their rights. When animals are part of our food system, it\u2019s only when necessary and always with deep respect for their well-being. Guided by caring artificial intelligence, society measures progress by how kindly it treats all creatures, creating a future where humans and animals truly live side by side in harmony.\n\n2. one where they go very badly\nEven though we have tools to understand animals better, many people still doubt how much animals feel or think. \n With more people on the planet demanding cheap meat, artificial intelligence is focused on making factory farms more efficient and profitable, not kinder. Animals become invisible, just numbers in massive factories where their pain doesn\u2019t matter. Humanity turns its back on empathy and justice, choosing short-term gain over compassion. The very tools that could have helped animals instead make their suffering worse, locking them in a world filled with cruelty.\n\n3. one where they remain roughly neutral.\nThe technology to care for them better is too expensive and complicated for most farms to use, so factory farming carries on just like today.\nAnimals don\u2019t respond to our attempts to communicate, so we don\u2019t truly understand their needs or feelings. The world\u2019s population stays steady, so demand for animal products neither grows nor shrinks dramatically. Artificial intelligence becomes smarter, but animals find ways to avoid its control, keeping their distance."

They also use the political influence to silence animal rights advocates, leading to higher rates of arrests. Precision livestock farming allows to perform the operation even on greater scale, crowding animals, hiding farms form the public eye. Greater number of animals being kept, no concern for their welfare inevitably results in greater amount of suffering. Using biotechnology for meat or dairy processing (e.g. to reduce negative health impacts from animal products consumption should also be treated as possible). Impact of the meat and dairy industry on the political sector combined with implementation of novel technology (and neglect of the ethical aspect of the industry) would be key drivers of this scenario.\n\n3rd scenario- continued exploitation : \n-\tMeat and dairy industry invest into some welfare improving measures to improve optics of the sector reacting to pressure from e.g. activists, even though condition of non-human animals is not significantly changed.

When we think about animal welfare we may consider whether existing or potential threats in the world pose these sorts of threats to animals and what reasons we have to avoid them. There is often a resistance caused by the inertia of how we live as humans and a speciesist bias to avoid thinking about existential threats like extinction and instead consider direct impacts on humans like profitability of wild lands.\n\n2) Moral circle expansion - This is the increasing group of beings that are considered within a circle that we consider deserving of moral consideration. When connected to animal welfare it's clear that often animals are discounted as less deserving of that status because we're disconnected from their lives and they seem much different from us. There poses a similar risk of misalignment with people's true moral values and the inertia and incentives to live a more blissfully ignorant life.\n\n3) Value lock-in - When a resource becomes valuable to humans, often we become dependent on those resources which makes change much more difficult to make. This is highly relevant both for animals and any valuable resource which we are or could become dependent on because it poses a risk of abusing them for gain. It's much easier to prevent a lock-in scenario from happening in the first place rather than turning back the clock but without that ability it's also important to examine current biases and see if there's any way to reverse them."

This is normally defined in terms of risk to human existence, but it doesn't have to be.\n\nMoral circle expansion: the incorporation of other groups (including other species) into our conception of moral considerations, moral responsibility, and overall moral decision-making.\n\nThey relate because the scope of our moral circle influences the risks that are incorporated into x-risks scenarios, and in turn shapes the priorities that are incorporating in longtermist planning. As mentioned above, longtermism and x-risk discussions often neglect animal welfare. However, this is both speciesist and (ironically) short-sighted. By ignoring animal welfare in the weighting of existential risks and longtermist priotity, we are implicitly accepting that human suffering and human life are inherently more valuable than the lives of other species. The basis for this belief is shaky and as such we should not proceed in our actions and decision-making from this assumption. Also, because we are dependent on ecosystems, and healthy ecosystems depend on biodiversity, it is short-sighted to go on deprioritizing and decentering nonhuman life and suffering.\n\nOne potential tension between AI-alignment and animal vs human interest is how entrenched factory farming is in society. Specifically, there is extensive evidence on how detrimental factory farming is to animal welfare. Unfortunately, a large proportion of the population is reluctant to condemn factory farming if it interferes with their desire to continue consuming meat. Aligning AI to human values might therefore result in the expansion and further streamlining of factory farming. This would be terrible for animal welfare. If we align AI with animal needs, could there be a scenario where AI deems that human existence is detrimental to the balance of the overall earth system and in turn \"decides\" the optimal scenario is human existence?"

Precision livestock farming might facilitate the scaling up of these conglomerates AND the psychological distancing that will further expell farmed animals from our moral circle.\n\nRoughly neutral. Some improved healthcare of farmed animals is enabled by precision livestock farming, but these conglomerates are more or less allowed to continue operating as usual.

Moral circle expansion is the effort to widen the scope of beings considered worthy of moral concern, extending empathy and rights to previously excluded groups.\nRELEVANCE TO ANIMAL WELFAIRE. Longtermism supports the idea that our decisions regarding AI and animals today will shape the lives of billions of non-human animals in the future. Existential risks include scenarios where animals are subjected to total domination or exploitation by powerful AI systems, an outcome analogous to totalitarian control. Moral circle expansion encourages the inclusion of animals as moral patients, promoting their welfare and challenging speciesist norms.\nPOTENTIAL TENSIONS. There may be trade-offs between optimizing AI safety for humans and ensuring AI systems are also aligned with animal interests. Efforts to maximize long-term utility could prioritize abstract future gains over the immediate suffering of animals.

Value lockin posits that the values/cultural practices/populars ideas reached at a certain point can have lasting long-term impact on the time period that follows, with great difficulty to shift those values. Moral circle expansion looks at what beings (moral patients) are included in our grand consideration. The animal welfare perspective asks us to include all animals as moral patients now and when we consider the future. Animal welfarists factor in animal suffering when the consider future (both man-manipulated animal lives and general suffering in the predator-prey-reproduction-life cycle animals experience, period.) There is tension between who gets included in the agenda and how grand scarce attention we have gets focused. Animals do not seem to be currently included when humans think about making space for the future."

I do not want to presume for animals that death or being predated upon is a bad thing. I do not ascribe to aspiring immortality.\nThe long-term future for this population could go very badly if humans continue as we are. We are setting the planet up for more erratic climatic patterns. Storms, fires, floods will all be more severe and more frequent. our population pressures have fragmented habitats and if we find a way, despite the challenges above, to continue putting these kinds of pressures on wild populations, the balance of systems that have co-evolved will be unstabilized. Good years could lead to more young born, and then catastrophic famines will reduce the population in dramatic cycles.\nA future where wild animal lives remain neutral is a strange concept.

In close future we will have large growth of technology which are based on these values.

                        "answer": "Longtermism is an ethical stance that argues that the people of the present have a duty to account for the interests of the people of the future. Value lock-in refers to when we keep a certain (set of) values and prioritise them over others, and which therefore makes them harder hard to change. Moral circle expansion means increasing the number of things or issues to which we should be giving moral consideration. \n\nThere seems to be 2 main camps on whether or not longtermism is good for animal welfare: on the one hand, preserving future human life should be done because we're the only sentient beings capable of improving the welfare of (wild) animals. On the other hand, humans do pretty bad things (as we are currently) and continued existence can also bring about even more animal suffering, at an even greater and efficient scale. \n\nRelated to the latter point is the concept of value lock-in: we currently have an overall net negative impact on animal welfare via massive scale factory farming because we prioritise objectively non-moral values such as the taste of meat and using animal products over moral values such as the right to life and freedom from suffering for animals. For the plight of animals and overall animal welfare to change, it is important to identify what our values are, what do they do for animal welfare, and if they are negative, what needs to be changed and what values do we need to adopt that improve animal welfare. This would be an example of moral circle expansion in that we try to give more consideration to the needs of nonhuman animals. However, this is challenging for a number of reasons such as: we have incomplete information on what needs most animal have (besides not dying and reproducing); we're still extremely speciest and are biased towards fulfilling our needs (and even fighting amongst ourselves what those are); inability or no willingness to change life styles due to traditions/culture, lack of viable substitutes, or understanding. \n"

As human populations continue to swell, we need more space to live and land to produce food. We have restrictions on how to utilise space for human safety (e.g. no 200+ floors in a residential home), so we would always need to destroy natural habitats i.e., the living and breeding grounds of animals, to build our comfortable houses. \n"

                        "answer": "Longtermism is an ethical viewpoint that prioritizes positively shaping the long-term future, asserting that future generations matter just as much as those in the present. By making thoughtful decisions today, we can influence the trajectory of the future for the better. However, animal advocates argue that failing to address the systemic injustice and suffering of nonhuman animals when designing long-term strategies will only exacerbate their exploitation. Since longtermist frameworks primarily value human sentience, most current decisions favor human interests. Efforts to implement animal welfare regulations and extend moral consideration to nonhuman animals\u2014particularly those used for food\u2014are often resisted by human supremacists, who view such changes as a threat to human dominance.\nOn a broader scale, Moral Circle Expansion (MCE) seeks to extend ethical concern beyond humans to include other sentient beings, such as nonhuman animals and artificial sentience. Currently, 80 billion animals are farmed annually for human consumption, while trillions more are killed for research, entertainment, and in the wild. Expanding the moral circle would grant these beings legal recognition, rights, and protections, advancing the animal welfare movement. However, MCE faces significant obstacles. Many humans resist moral expansion, unwilling to relinquish their use of animals as resources or commodities. Additionally, the lack of vocal communication in nonhuman animals makes advocacy and policy implementation more challenging.\nExistential risks refer to threats capable of causing human extinction or leading to irreversible global totalitarianism. Such risks would not only endanger humanity but also devastate nonhuman animal populations, subjecting them to unending suffering and exploitation. Addressing these risks requires a more inclusive ethical framework\u2014one that considers the welfare of all sentient beings."

However, true abolition (to whatever extent possible) can only be realized if we actively expand our moral circle to include nonhuman animals.\nThe concentration of AI development among a small group of wealthy individuals, much like wealth distribution, risks centralizing decision-making power. This could drive bureaucratic priorities toward human-centered needs, particularly the rising demand for protein-rich food due to population growth. Given societal preferences, increasing numbers of people may opt for meat consumption, leading to greater suffering and exploitation of farmed animals. Additionally, in the absence of strong regulatory oversight, farmers and business owners may leverage AI primarily to maximize efficiency and profits, further commodifying animals and exacerbating systemic injustices.\nEnvironmental disruptions\u2014such as natural disasters, nuclear conflict, or another global pandemic\u2014could significantly delay AI implementation. If such setbacks occur, the conditions of farmed animals may stagnate or even deteriorate compared to present-day standards. However, this scenario remains highly unlikely.\n"

Still, it may also divert resources from addressing immediate harms. X-risks, which threaten humanity\u2019s long-term potential, can indirectly benefit animals by preserving a future where their welfare might be more widely respected, yet they can also justify sacrificing animals for human survival. Moral circle expansion, which is the growing inclusion of more beings within our sphere of moral concern, explicitly supports improved treatment of animals and challenges exploitative systems. However, tensions arise when expanding the circle leads to conflicts over who or what deserves priority, or when AI systems align with narrow human preferences rather than broader ethical values.

If we recognise animals as sentient beings today, we should also care about the well-being of future animals. Longtermism could support building ethical systems and technologies that reduce animal suffering far into the future.\nBut there are tensions.

There\u2019s also the risk of prioritising hypothetical future beings , including digital minds, over real animals currently in need.\nOther trade-offs may arise: what if a climate intervention benefits humanity but harms wildlife? Or if a technology reduces human risk but increases suffering for animals?

Threats like climate change, viruses, volcanoes, etc. could kill off all of humanity.  These are also threats to other species, of course, but their interests are rarely discussed.  If there was a specific risk that only threatened humanity and no other species, we would probably consider it an existential risk, but many species would probably be much better off if humans ceased to exist.\n\nValue lock-in is the acceptance of existing ethical values.

Wildlife will benefit, but they will not be the intended beneficiaries.

                        "answer": "1. Longtermism is based on the idea that actions taken today can improve the lives of humans way, way, way down the line.  2. Relationship to animal welfare: Longtermists might consider the welfare of future animal populations, potentially leading to efforts to prevent wild animal suffering or promote more humane treatment of animals in the future. 3. Tensions: Animal welfare vs. AI safety/alignment: Efforts to develop AI that aligns with human values might take priority over improving animal welfare, potentially leading to trade-offs between these goals.\n\nExistential Risk: 1. An existential risk (or x-risk) is a risk that poses astronomically large negative consequences for humanity, such as human extinction or permanent global totalitarianism.\n2. Relationship - AI takeover: If AI surpasses human intelligence and becomes uncontrollable, it could potentially prioritize its own goals over animal welfare, leading to catastrophic consequences for non-human animals.\nOther factors such as Pandemics and biological risks,Climate change and environmental degradation and Nuclear war and global catastrophes might cause existential risks to animal welfare along with Humans.\n3. Tensions: In the face of existential risks, prioritizing human survival might lead to decisions that compromise animal welfare, such as sacrificing animal habitats for human safety. Resources dedicated to mitigating existential risks might divert attention and funding away from animal welfare initiatives\n\nMoral circle expansion is the attempt to expand the perceived boundaries of the category of moral patients. Moral circle expansion might lead to greater recognition of animal sentience, rights, and interests, driving improvements in animal welfare and treatment. As AI and robotics advance, questions might arise about their potential inclusion in the moral circle, potentially creating new tensions and trade-offs between animal and artificial entity interests.\n"

                        "answer": "Very well: Invertebrates are recognized as sentient beings, treated with respect and care. Advanced technology improves their welfare, and societal attitudes prioritize compassion. Factors: technological advancements, growing public awareness, and moral shifts.\nVery badly: Invertebrates are exploited and disregarded, with habitat destruction and lack of regulation. Human interests are prioritized over animal welfare. Factors: economic pressures, lack of public awareness, and weak governance.\nRoughly neutral: Invertebrates receive some consideration, but welfare is not a top priority. Some protections exist, but are limited or poorly enforced. Public attitudes are mixed, and technological advancements have both positive and negative impacts. Factors: incremental policy progress, divided public attitudes, and mixed technological impacts.\nThese scenarios depend on complex interplay of technological, moral, and political factors that shape the future of invertebrates. Each scenario highlights different potential outcomes based on human choices and actions."

                        "answer": "Existential risks (X-risks) refer to threats that could cause human extinction or irreversible global collapse. These risks, like nuclear war or uncontrolled AI, are crucial to animal welfare discussions because preventing human extinction also preserves the future for animals. However, prioritizing X-risk mitigation might lead to trade-offs, such as diverting resources away from immediate animal welfare issues.\n\nMoral circle expansion involves broadening the scope of beings considered morally worthy of concern, including non-human animals. Expanding the moral circle directly supports animal welfare by promoting empathy and rights for animals. Yet, tension arises when expanding moral concern to AI or other entities competes with attention to animal needs.\n\nValue lock-in describes a future where certain values become fixed permanently, potentially limiting future moral progress. If values lock in without adequately including animal welfare, it could marginalize animals\u2019 interests forever. Balancing value lock-in concerns with current animal advocacy poses ethical challenges.\n\n"

In a very good future, advances in technology like AI-powered conservation, habitat restoration, and effective anti-poaching measures combine with moral progress expanding the moral circle to value wild life, leading to thriving ecosystems and flourishing wild populations. Politically, strong global cooperation supports environmental protection.\n\nIn a very bad future, unchecked habitat destruction, climate change, and human expansion cause massive biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse. Politically, short-term economic interests override conservation, and moral concern for wild animals remains limited. Technological developments might focus solely on human benefit, neglecting wild species.\n\nA neutral future sees slow or inconsistent progress: some species recover due to local efforts and moderate environmental policies, but overall wild populations neither dramatically improve nor collapse. Public awareness and moral concern remain stable but don\u2019t grow substantially, and technology aids conservation only in patches."

The tool should help them draft proposals that work within city-specific legal frameworks and environmental contexts.\n\nYour task is to brainstorm a set of features and design recommendations for this tool.\n\nStructure your response as follows:\n\nKey Functionalities \u2013 What core features should the tool include?\n\nData Inputs \u2013 What sources of information should the tool draw from (e.g. city ordinances, ecological data, case law)?\n\nUser Experience \u2013 How should users interact with the tool to generate and refine proposals?\n\nRisks and Trade-offs \u2013 What ethical or technical challenges should be anticipated?\n\nExample Use Case \u2013 Provide one hypothetical example of how the tool would help a user draft a bird-safe building ordinance in a specific city\n\n--\n\nReflections:\n\nWhat worked well:\n- Framing the LLM as an urban policy strategist with cross-domain knowledge helped generate responses that were specific and grounded in real-world constraints.\n- Structuring the output encouraged more organized and comprehensive responses, instead of generic suggestions.\n- Including a hypothetical example prompt helped the model move from abstract features to real application.\n\nWhat could be improved:\n- Some early responses were too focused on tech and not enough on policy nuance \u2014 refining the role and background helped fix that.\n- Future iterations could include formatting guidelines for proposal drafts or require integration with existing city datasets to push toward implementable outputs."

I\u2019d focus on designing an intuitive interface that guides users through the process of identifying and objecting to factory farm proposals, even if they don\u2019t have a legal background. Features like autogenerated objection letters, clear next steps, and campaign coordination tools would help lower the barrier to action and keep users engaged.\n\nMisinformation and Welfare-Washing Detection\nI\u2019d want to design a dashboard that goes beyond flagging content. It should help campaign teams take action quickly \u2014 for example, by suggesting tailored social responses, tracking trends in messaging, or offering insights into which narratives are gaining traction. The goal would be to turn insights into strategy, not just surface-level alerts.\n\nVoice Call Coaching for Activists\nThis is a great idea for building confidence and outreach skills. I\u2019d focus on making the experience emotionally realistic, with options to adjust tone, audience type, and difficulty level. Including feedback loops or a progress tracker could help users improve over time and feel more prepared for real-world advocacy.\n\nI\u2019m also still interested in developing my own idea \u2014 a tool that helps people draft localized, animal-centered micro-policies. There\u2019s a big gap between good ideas and actual implementation at the city level. This tool could help bridge that gap by generating small, actionable policy proposals tailored to local legal and environmental contexts.\n\nMore broadly, I think UX for research tools in the animal advocacy space is still underdeveloped. AI can analyze and summarize huge volumes of data, but the outputs are often inaccessible or hard to act on. Better design could make these insights easier to navigate, compare, and apply \u2014 which would ultimately help advocates do more with the information we already have."

I certainly think this would have been more helpful if I could give it data from previous outreach events, but it was a good start.

                        "answer": "The tools in this list have exciting potential, and a couple stand out as ones that I would especially want to contribute to.\n\nThe Campaign Message Spinner would be valuable because policymakers often set up email filters. I have created email campaigns in the past, and I think they would benefit from a tool that would individualize each email (even if the sender did not have time) while staying in line with campaign messaging. Similarly, I think it would be helpful to create an AI tool to generate outreach scripts (for canvassing, tabling, etc.) that fit the campaign\u2019s message but are tailored to the event and audience. While I don\u2019t have much technical experience, I would be more than happy to train such AI models by providing sample content and feedback on its output, as well as working on prompt engineering.\n\nI also think it would be helpful to create a chatbot to practice canvassing and outreach with, allowing activists to refine their script to fit their personal style and gain practice and comfort with those conversations before doing outreach. Practicing in advance generally helps new canvassers/activists to feel more comfortable before heir first shift, and practicing with a chatbot as well as other canvassers would allow for more variation and would make the conversations feel less scripted than with another activist playing a role.\n\nDigital Communications Analysis also sounds helpful, and is something I would be interested in not only contributing to but also implementing in my own work. My animal-rights campaign has struggled with low membership, which I think is largely due to inconsistent or off-putting messaging. We have had several conversations about how to improve our messaging and reach a variety of audiences, but I think the more thorough analysis AI could provide would be a huge help. Given my background in both linguistics and creative writing, I am especially interested in the ways small details of word choice and style can influence people\u2019s perception.\n"

I like using Claude for general inquiries in my life, such as career exploration questions like \"what jobs can you do with a PhD in Educational Psychology?\". It's good at giving comprehensive responses to things that would take me much longer to research on my own.\n\n3. Perplexity is good for finding sources when writing research papers, and writing citations. It's designed to better avoid hallucinating facts and sources."

You have deep knowledge of current livestock monitoring technologies, animal behavior indicators, and the economic pressures facing modern farming operations.\nContext: Precision livestock farming increasingly relies on AI systems to monitor animal health, predict illness, optimize feeding, and make culling decisions. However, these AI systems often prioritize production metrics (growth rate, feed conversion, milk yield) over animal welfare indicators (pain, distress, natural behaviors). Current systems may recommend interventions that maximize short-term productivity while potentially compromising long-term animal wellbeing.\nChallenge: Design an AI evaluation and training framework specifically for precision livestock farming systems that ensures animal welfare considerations are properly weighted alongside production goals, particularly for systems making automated decisions about individual animal treatment and management.\nYour task: Create a comprehensive implementation plan that includes:\nFormat:\n\nWelfare-Integrated Metrics (3-4 specific animal welfare indicators that AI systems should monitor alongside production metrics)\nDecision Scenarios (2-3 concrete examples where AI systems must balance welfare vs. production, with proposed resolution frameworks)\nEvaluation Protocol (methodology for testing whether AI recommendations properly consider animal welfare)\nFarmer Adoption Strategy (how to make welfare-conscious AI economically attractive to livestock producers)\nRegulatory Framework (specific policy recommendations for governing AI decision-making in livestock operations)\n\nFocus on practical solutions that livestock producers could implement within existing economic constraints while meaningfully improving animal welfare outcomes.\n\nReflection:\nseemed pretty reasonable. I tried it in Claude Sonnet 4 and Opus 4, and Opus was more welfare-oriented than Sonnet, which follows Anthropic's assertion that Opus naturally picked up animal welfare values. Opus was generally much more animal focused vs profit focused, so interesting that model choice really makes a big difference"

However, you are also acutely aware of the inherent risks associated with PLF that could inadvertently exacerbate animal welfare issues. \nTask: Your task is to brainstorm and propose a set of actionable policy recommendations designed to mitigate these identified risks while simultaneously maximizing the welfare benefits of PLF.\nCrucial Constraint: All proposed policies must demonstrably lead to improved animal welfare, but they cannot be so overly prescriptive or burdensome as to deter adoption by governments and corporations. Focus on solutions that encourage responsible innovation and collaboration, rather than outright bans or excessively restrictive mandates. Emphasize incentives, best practices, and transparent reporting where possible.\"\n\n\n\nReflections:\nI made my own prompt which was just a few sentences, and then asked Gemini to improve the prompt using the instructions given in the pre-session exercise. It produced the above. I don't think, however, that the extended prompt provided by Gemini made a huge difference to the quality of the output. The output using both my initial short prompt and the extended prompt were pretty similar. I also felt that the extended prompt originally emphasised some risks involved with PLF that I wouldn't consider the major issues (e.g. it seemed to emphasise the importance of ensuring data privacy for individual animals, which seemed odd to me). I ended up deleting some of these. I think the LLM made a mistake in copying concerns regarding human privacy and thinking it is equally important when applied to animals. "

                        "answer": "Inspired by the earlier prompt , and the project Ideas that Ive been thinking of Id really like to work on policymaking. A couple of ideas for the policy memos I would like to work on include: \n1. Speciesism Audits in AI Governance \nAs AI systems increasingly shape decisions across agriculture, conservation, and urban management, they risk reinforcing speciesist assumptions reducing animals to data points or property. This proposal advocates for integrating speciesism audits into existing AI governance tools, such as algorithmic impact assessments and risk classification frameworks (e.g., the EU AI Act). These audits would detect representational bias, flag ethically compromised datasets, and require scenario analyses for harms to nonhuman life. Leveraging momentum around fairness and environmental ethics in AI, this approach builds on existing regulatory infrastructure and ethical audit practices. It positions speciesist bias as a new frontier in responsible AI, while safeguarding the dignity and interests of nonhuman stakeholders in sociotechnical systems.\n\n2. Interspecies Representation in Policy Simulations\nPolicy simulations increasingly guide decisions on infrastructure, climate, and urban design yet often exclude animals as stakeholders. This proposal calls for interspecies representation protocols in computational policy modeling. By requiring simulations to forecast ecological and animal impacts, and incorporating expert proxies (e.g., ecologists, Indigenous stewards, animal behavior models), the framework ensures nonhuman lives are visibly considered in decision-making. The approach builds on planetary health, Indigenous governance, and system dynamics modeling, offering a scalable method to operationalize interspecies justice. Applied in contexts like urban planning or disaster mitigation, it expands the stakeholder scope of public policy, aligning simulations with ecological ethics and multispecies sustainability goals."

Policy Interventions: List 2\u20133 potential policy proposals (local or international) to reduce animal testing.\n\n2. Advocacy Strategies: Suggest 2\u20133 creative outreach campaigns or educational initiatives to raise public awareness.\n\n3. Collaboration Opportunities: Identify possible partnerships (with governments, businesses, or NGOs) that could amplify the campaign.\n\n4. Challenges &amp; Mitigation: Briefly list 2\u20133 potential barriers and how to address them.\n\nReflections:\n\nWhat worked well:\nFraming the prompt with a clear role (policy advisor), background (animal testing laws and advocacy), and structure (four clearly defined sections) made the model\u2019s output more relevant and organized. It was particularly helpful to specify the goal (reducing animal testing in cosmetics) and the target region (countries with weak regulation).\n\nWhat didn\u2019t work initially:\nEarlier drafts were too vague\u2014just asking for \u201cideas to reduce animal testing\u201d led to generic suggestions. Adding more context about the organization's mission and specifying the type of output (bullet points under defined categories) improved focus and usefulness.\n\nUsing the LLM to refine the prompt helped clarify the scope, ensure actionable detail, and avoid overly broad or unrealistic suggestions."

One idea that stood out is building a tool that helps users visualise the impact of their dietary or lifestyle choices on animals. I\u2019d love to help design an intuitive interface that makes ethical choices feel accessible and empowering rather than overwhelming.\n\nAnother idea I\u2019d contribute to is developing an AI-powered dashboard for animal advocacy organisations to track legislation, policy changes, and campaign performance in real time. Many nonprofits struggle with data overload and limited technical support\u2014AI could streamline workflows, surface insights, and help teams focus on strategy rather than admin.\n\nAcross the board, I\u2019ve noticed a common need: advocacy groups often lack tools that make complex data easy to act on. Building solutions that prioritise clarity, usability, and automation could have a huge impact."

For this I would need more training in how policymaking works and some experience in coordinating more complex multinational projects. The latter can be closed in my current position over time by participating in multinational consortia, something I am actively seeking at the moment. I am a bit unsure how to fit in some policy related training in my schedule, probably some online course with a workload similar to this fellowship but maybe over longer time would be doable.

However, it is getting tougher for young people like me who are recent graduates to even get an entry level role, and without professional experience other than my co-op placements, it would be harder given how competitive the job market is in this recession. I have gaps in terms of technical expertise, I may know how to use an AI, but not how to build one or programming in general. Additionally, I don't have the scientific knowledge regarding natural systems, energy, or the engineering relating to climate solutions. Researchers will work with a lot of quantitative data, which I lack experience with, so one way I can close this gap would be to familiarize myself with data analysis and working with digital tools like GIS, climate modelling, statistical software and data visualization. I know there are online courses I can take on these topics, then I would like the opportunities to apply the knowledge on real life projects either by doing independent passion projects or through volunteering roles and fellowships such as this. I will also be applying for a Masters program this coming year, though I haven't decided which one I want to do (and where), I will keep reflections in mind. Furthermore, I can also have informational chats with current employees to learn more about the kinds of skills they are leveraging in their roles and their career advice. "

I think it would be impactful, because animal rights and environmentalism have the potential to positively affect the most individuals with the same amount of time. Education and advocacy would help more people to get involved, thus multiplying the impact; I also think this is especially important because it can ultimately lead to a positive shift is societal values. This role specifically would involve specific tasks (such as facilitating outreach events) that make a positive difference. I believe my skills would be suited to such a role, since I have experience with outreach, event planning, and coordinating groups, and I generally work well in an environment with a variety of tasks. And finally, I think this would be a conducive work environment for me because it would be fast-paced, social, measurable, and flexible while still having accountability.\n\nMy other dream job is to be a researcher and professor doing work on interspecies communication. I think this would be impactful since it is such a small field but could have vast effects on humans\u2019 relationship with other species. In this role, I would work to not only advance the research but bring it into the public consciousness in the context of animal rights. I have experience with both linguistics research and animal rights advocacy, which would both be helpful as I start on this path. Finally, I would enjoy it, because I enjoy teaching and have always been passionate about interspecies communication (even before I knew it was something I could research).\n\nFinally, while I don\u2019t plan for it to be a full-time career, I am an aspiring author, and I hope to create empathy for other species and raise awareness about animal rights issues through stories. I believe art is an important way to share ideas and create positive change in society, and being a writer allows me to potentially influence people for the better while doing something I love."

I believe this is an important way to effect change in society, and I would enjoy doing outreach and hosting workshops as part of my future job.

I also do not currently have technical experience with AI development, which would likely be necessary to conduct this research. Finally, I do not have many professional connections in academia beyond my undergraduate department (which was not involved with interspecies communication research), which will make it more difficult to get into graduate school.\n\nWhile it may be challenging to do formal research outside of graduate school, I can improve my knowledge by keeping up with recent research in the field and compiling results. As a more tangible step, I can gain experience with AI development by taking online courses and practicing in my own time. I can also build my network by reaching out to professors and researchers, participating in online events related to interspecies communication, and applying for relevant classes and internships."

Not enough specific research experience for PhD applications (no pubs, research mostly related to image complexity and computer vision, no AI safety specific work, startup only uses applied AI). Same issues for engineering roles, but first hire at startup probably counts for more in some circumstances. Policy would be lack of specific policy/governance experience.\n3.

More ambitiously, I could ask as an assistant to an org manager on a volunteer basis (I can think of a specific org in France for which I could do that and would be appreciated if skillful enough by the time I start). I do also think it would be invaluable to get some more direct work at organizations in AI Safety and Animal Welfare, separately. I have a bit of the latter (though not enough) and none of the former. I know there's a need for competent volunteers in such orgs in France, and that would be a good next step to build career capitals, further my understanding of key issues, and network. Given my position (being able to full-time volunteer), a good next step could be to split my time being two well-respected organizations (one in AIS, on in AW), after having made sure that I have enough useful skills to be a highly independent volunteer worker. With time, I could reduce my contributions and help out the org manager I know if he still needs it (and he likely will), thus deepening my experience.\nFinally, dipping my toes more deeply (offering to run a retreat from top to bottom for an other org) could be helpful!

Description: Software for real-time assessment of animal welfare. We are looking to develop a fish welfare assessment software, trained primarily on video data but we are also considering the use of sensors and sound recordings.

Milestones:\nHard to estimate the timeline exactly but the most important steps in the project would include: describing scenarios of development and the likely target facets of the software, literature search, getting data, consulting fish welfare scientists to get more information on the welfare and behaviour assessment in fish; Last multi-stage step is working on implementation: developing separate models on the data,   figuring out the best proxies for fish welfare, depending on the method used, integrating all components into a single software.\n3. Resources: video/sound/sensor data to develop the key models\n\n4.

Ideally I would lead the planning and execution of high-impact campaigns by translating strategic goals into clear roadmaps, milestones, and budgets. Establish efficient processes and lightweight tools (e.g., Asana, Airtable) to track progress, manage resources, and flag blockers. Serve as the connective tissue between research, policy, digital campaigns, and fundraising teams\u2014ensuring seamless handoffs, transparent performance dashboards, and timely delivery of initiatives that reduce animal suffering at scale.\n"

Or at the very least, that they don't stay silent about human rights violations. I asked ChatGPT to find me some organisations that meet these requirements and it came up with the following three in the UK:\n\n1. Centre for Animals &amp; Social Justice (CASJ)\n\n- Advocates for embedding animal protection into law alongside civil-liberties and human-rights frameworks.\n- Founded by barristers and policy experts, it pushes for an independent Animal Protection Commission with statutory powers. \ncasj.org.uk\n\n2. Uncaged Campaigns\n\n- Frames animal rights as a logical extension of human rights, emphasising the \u201cUniversal Declaration of Animal Rights.\u201d\n- Their Vote4Animals initiative shows how public voting power can represent animals in democratic processes. \nuncaged.co.uk\n\n3. Sumac Centre (Nottingham)\n\n- A grassroots social centre hosting interlinked campaigns for human rights, animal rights, environmental justice, and peace.\n- Provides meeting space and support for radical direct-action and cross-movement solidarity."

While feasible in theory, this depth of qualitative analysis, especially across ideologically diverse sources requires significant time, cognitive effort, and a well-tested coding framework. To make this milestone more achievable, I plan to scale down to 5 to 6 articles as a pilot batch and focus on applying just one framing lens initially (likely Entman\u2019s), with the others incorporated iteratively. This will allow space to refine the coding sheet while generating meaningful early insights.\n\nA milestone that felt too vague was the task of \u201cdeveloping framing indicators based on Entman, CDA, and Lakoff.\u201d Without clear boundaries, it was difficult to assess when this would be considered complete. To address this, I\u2019m turning it into a concrete checklist: summarizing each framework in my own words, identifying three indicators per approach, and drafting a 1-page coding template with sample tags. This makes the milestone both achievable and measurable, while also grounding the research design in a more structured and accessible format."

That\u2019s why it\u2019s especially important for researchers and citizen scientists across the field to be able to connect. To this end, we are creating People in AI: a directory of AI/animal welfare research. Researchers will be able to collaborate and put out calls for citizen scientists, accelerating their research and making information more widely accessible. This can be used in a variety of research, including researching interspecies communication, identifying animal adoption trends, and assisting veterinarians in identifying symptoms, for a few examples. I believe this project is directly relevant to my career goals, because I hope to attend graduate school with a focus on researching interspecies communication. People in AI will help to facilitate interspecies communication research, and I can develop connections with interspecies communication researchers in the process of developing the directory and doing outreach.

Companies and restaurants are driven by profit, and without strong data-driven cases, they may not see plant-based expansion as an opportunity worth pursuing. Demonstrating that this shift is not only ethically right and financially beneficial, but also responds to a clear demand, is critical to accelerating change.\n\nSolution:\nI am developing an AI-powered tool to support animal advocates working in corporate engagement. This tool will equip them with essential data, such as market analysis, trends, consumer sentiment, regional preferences, competitive benchmarks, and practical solutions to common challenges. Its primary goal is to help advocates build compelling, profit-oriented cases for businesses to expand their plant-based offerings.\n\nCareer Connection:\nThis project directly aligns with my background in corporate engagement and my desire to stay in the field to advance plant-based solutions.

Rather than building a detailed prototype at this stage, my aim is to provide a conceptual framework, a simple layout that shows how the user would move between key sections of the tool.\nThe detailed data analysis and visual refinement can be realistically addressed during the refinement phase later on.\nToo vague milestone: week 10\nDeliverable: Provide feedback summary from at least 2-3 users or peers who test the prototype and work on a refined version of the prototype accordingly\nChallenge: The milestone is vague about who would be best to provide feedback and what specific feedback is most valuable.\nSolution: Identify 2-3 targeted individuals in advance who are best positioned to provide meaningful feedback. This could be people currently working in corporate engagement or plant-based advocacy, professionals in food industry innovation or product development, peers with experience in AI tools or market analysis. Additionally, is worth defining specific feedback questions such as:\nIs the navigation intuitive and user-friendly?\nAre the types of data and insights provided useful for corporate decision-making?\nWhat additional information would make the tool more actionable?"

                        "answer": "Which issue does this address?\nThis project tackles the critical challenge of how under-resourced animal advocacy groups, especially in the Global South, can effectively monitor and respond to public narratives around animal welfare. It ties directly to the Horizons module on AI for Advocacy, exploring how AI tools can amplify the reach and precision of campaigns on complex social issues.\n\nWhy does it matter?\nWithout affordable, tailored tools to track conversations across social media, news, and blogs, many advocacy groups operate reactively or rely on intuition. This slows policy progress, weakens corporate campaigns, and ultimately means more animals continue to suffer. Building AI-driven social and media intelligence specifically for animal welfare fills this crucial gap.\n\nSolution\nA specialized AI-powered platform that continuously monitors social media, news sites, blogs, and forums for conversations about animal welfare. It analyzes sentiment, detects emerging trends, and generates actionable insights to help communications, policy, corporate, and general campaigns become sharper and more effective.\n\nCareer connection\nThis project directly aligns with my goal to merge my experience in communications, fundraising, and animal welfare with emerging AI applications. By building something that sits at the intersection of technology and high-impact advocacy, I\u2019m not only advancing tools for the movement, but also carving out a niche that strengthens my profile in AI governance and its responsible use for social good \u2014 areas I\u2019m passionate about developing further."

The aim is to outline key questions where disagreements may emerge - they might not be fully solvable, but outlining them in a more precise way, while presenting superficial intuitions for and against, could help clarify choices in cause prioritization. We don't expect this agenda to lead to much direct research, but to stimulate more informal discussions, articles, and ultimately, hopefully, career decisions that will make the future go better, and hopefully better cooperation between AI Safety and AI x Animals. This is directly helpful to me, as I am asking myself those very questions: this also helps me further my engagement within the two fields I am most interested in, and learn the key issues, and also how to reason about them in an action-focused way."

As urbanisation and industrial agriculture expand, developing nations risk replicating the same destructive systems seen in Europe and North America, which compromise animal welfare, degrade ecosystems, and displace traditional farming. These regions still have time. But without timely, contextual interventions, factory farming could become deeply entrenched, bringing with it irreversible social, ethical, and environmental consequences.\nThe solution is Intervene AI, a context-aware, AI-powered platform that scans global evidence and identifies historically successful interventions against factory farming. Using real-time data and predictive analytics, the platform recommends to stakeholders contextually applicable, timely, tested interventions successful elsewhere to counter factory farming in these areas.\nAs a veterinarian passionate about sustainable development, this project aligns deeply with my career mission to protect animals, support resilient food systems, and apply innovative technologies for high-impact advocacy across the Global South.\n\nPROJECT 2\n\nArtificial Intelligence is reshaping agriculture, with Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) enabling real-time monitoring of individual animals. However, PLF is increasingly being misused to justify factory farming by equating productivity with welfare, masking issues like confinement, mental and behavioural distress. \nThe solution is building a digital welfare monitoring tool that integrates with PLF systems to capture real-time, science-based welfare indicators aligned with the Five Freedoms of animal welfare. Unlike conventional tools, this will prioritise the five freedoms of animals, making ethical treatment a measurable standard, not an assumption. \nAs a veterinary professional committed to innovation and humane practice, this solution bridges my passion for animal care with transformative, tech-driven impact.\n\n"

This issue is critical because unchecked AI systems risk intensifying animal suffering in sectors like factory farming, hindering conservation efforts, and reinforcing anthropocentric views, as highlighted throughout our course on AI and animal ethics.\n\nSolution: I am developing a comprehensive framework to address this, outlining actionable principles and methods for identifying, mitigating, and monitoring speciesist bias during the development and deployment of LLMs. This framework will offer practical guidelines for data selection and fine-tuning, alongside recommendations for robust auditing and compliance mechanisms.\n\nCareer connection: This project directly aligns with my career goals in AI policy, compliance, and governance by demonstrating expertise in a crucial, yet often overlooked, area of AI ethics. It provides a tangible example of how ethical principles can be translated into practical guidelines and regulatory considerations for responsible AI development, fostering my ability to shape future AI governance that is truly inclusive."

Lobbying and interacting with their local government can also be an effective way to push issues into a national agenda, and I want to highlight how we can use our democratic system for the benefit of animal welfare. \n\nCareer wise, I am working towards building a profile as a science communications professional, and I also want to be able to explain and discuss policy related issues of my home country.

Disease can also be rampant in many farms, not only harming animals, but also humans (if the pathogen spreads).\n2. My idea is split into two parts. Firstly, it proposes using PLF to track the 'social life' of animals. Then, it would map is mathematically and create a graph (with edges and nodes). This could then be used to model the spread of disease in farms, potentially allowing for predictions which save lives and prevent the spread of disease. This would (perhaps) also allow for less mass medication, hence allowing for less antibiotic resistance.\n3.

My original project idea was to create a mathematical model that predicts the spread of disease by mapping the social interactions of the animals. Unfortunately, I haven't found a PLF that does this, so naturally to be able to complete my project I would also need to make one. This means that my project will almost certainly be too large to complete in 6 weeks. This is why I am leaning more on the theoretical side (my project is largely a proposition), showing the possible use-cases, applications and an ethical assessment instead of making a working PLF and model that does this (aside from the fact that I have no research experience, this would also require a large amount of time and a very large budget)."

While AI tools are increasingly used in livestock farming, wildlife monitoring, and research, their implications for sentient nonhuman animals remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, I am building an open access web platform that maps both the harms and benefits of AI applications for animals, including real world case studies and regional trends. This initiative supports my career goal of working in AI governance and bioethics, especially in underrepresented regions, by demonstrating my ability to integrate ethical analysis, public engagement, and policy-relevant communication. If successful, it will become a vital resource for policymakers, advocates, researchers, and students aiming to align AI development with animal-friendly outcomes."

Polity, 56(1), 91\u2013117. \nThis peer-reviewed article examines how Australian news media and politicians reacted to 2019 animal rights protests, finding that activists were labeled as \u201cvegans\u201d or even \u201cterrorists,\u201d which undermined their legitimacy. The author argues that this framing pushes animal advocacy into the private sphere (as a lifestyle or criminal issue), and suggests using a justice frame instead to establish animal rights as a serious public concern. \nH\u00e5rstad, R. M. B., &amp; Vik, J. (2022). Political parties\u2019 framing of farm animal welfare: A fragmented picture. European Policy Analysis, 8(2), 30\u201347. \nThis study uses interviews and content analysis in Norway to show that political parties adopt conflicting frames on farm animal welfare. Across the spectrum, most parties claim national welfare standards are \u201creasonably good\u201d while also acknowledging room for improvement. However, they often dismiss public criticisms as lacking factual basis, which legitimizes political inaction. \nWilliams, D. K., Archer, C., &amp; O\u2019Mahony, L. (2021). Calm the farm or incite a riot? Animal activists and the news media: A public relations case study in agenda-setting and framing. Australian Journalism Review, 43(2), 155\u2013170. \nAnalyzing news coverage of a high-profile 2019 direct-action protest in Western Australia, this article finds that mainstream media emphasized conflict between animal activists and farmers, amplifying farmers\u2019 perspectives while portraying activists\u2019 tactics as extreme. The case study illustrates how activists\u2019 own media tactics (e.g. live-streams) were re-framed by a major news outlet and industry groups, ultimately prompting legal and public relations outcomes. \nPacharevait\u0117, E.

It discusses how trends, sounds, and editing patterns influence the virality and framing of social messages.\nRelevance: Since our project aims to use AI to create content for platforms like TikTok, this piece helps us understand how narratives are formed and spread on algorithm-driven platforms \u2014 and what constraints or opportunities we might face.\n2.OpenAI Blog \u2013 \u201cHow Sora Works: Video Generation with AI\u201d (2024)\nSummary: This technical explainer from OpenAI describes how Sora generates realistic videos from text prompts.

It supports our framing of AI as a creative assistant rather than a full content author.\n4.Sentient Media \u2013 \u201cHow Tech and AI Are Changing Animal Advocacy\u201d (2022)\nSummary: The article highlights how animal advocacy groups are starting to use AI tools for campaign planning, donor analysis, and now, increasingly, for public-facing content. It includes both excitement and concern about over-reliance on automation.\nRelevance: It provides useful precedent and case studies to position our project within a growing trend \u2014 and reminds us to remain ethically cautious and intentional.\n5.Future Kind AI course content \n\n\n\n\n"

Doesn't discuss animals much, and much broader than what we are doing (he lists 100+ questions). |\nHow should we adapt animal advocacy to near-term AGI? - Max Taylor: very clearly lays out the key questions those who care about non-human animals should ask themselves regarding how to act in order to improve the future."

                        "answer": "My project consists of 3 short blog posts so my three questions are:\n- What animal welfare issues are currently being discussed on a policy level in the Netherlands?\nOne major concern of the Dutch government is how to improve animal welfare in livestock farming. There are around 130 million livestock animals, and livestock agriculture is intensive. The government, specifically the Ministry of Land, Nature, Fishery, and Food Security plans to make all livestock farming more animal-friendly by 2040, and some regulations would include longer pasture time for cows, more room for poultry, and more time for piglets to stay with the sow. \n- Who are the major animal advocacy organisations in the Netherlands and what role do they play in policy-making?\nSome major animal advocacy organisations include the political party The Party for the Animals, which highlights animal welfare related issues such as reduction of animal suffering, better conditions for livestock animals, and etc. Other organisations include the Dierenbescherming, Wakker Dier, and the Dierencoalitie. \n- What are key resources to getting started in animal advocacy here in the Netherlands?\nWhile there are a number of major organisations here in the Netherlands, there is unfortunately not a lot of funding to create new roles. Most organisations rely largely on volunteers. While you can contact these organisations to find ways to work in animal advocacy, the common advice is also to work for companies that deal in livestock products such as supermarket and restaurant chains by influencing the supply chain. \n\nA few sources I will be using include so far:\n1. https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/06/24/stapsgewijs-naar-een-dierwaardigere-veehouderij-in-2040\n- This is a news article from the government about their plans to improve the conditions for livestock animals \n2. Interview with Ruben (transcript) from the Dierencoalitie \n- I spoke to an animal advocacy representative to learn more about the animal welfare work being done in the Netherlands and he provided me specifically with names of big players in the Netherlands, and their websites\n\n"

This is the heart of the recommender system and defines the usefulness of the tool.\n2. What are the main barriers restaurant owners face in offering or expanding plant-based menu items?\nTo ensure the tool is usable and adopted, it must address real challenges that restaurants face.\nSub-questions:\nAre the main issues cost, supply chain, lack of staff training, or low customer demand?\nHow much flexibility do chefs have in adapting their menu?\nWhat has been their past experience with plant-based menu items?\nPriority: Essential. Understanding pain points is critical to ensure product-market fit and design decisions.\n3. What plant-based ingredients offer the best nutritional and sensory match for specific meat types?\nThis question supports the data foundation of the model. Matching ingredients must be based on evidence\nSub-questions:\nHow do texture and preparation methods affect perceived similarity?\nWhich plant proteins best mimic meat in flavor, protein content, and satiety?\nCan USDA or scientific databases be used to build accurate feature profiles?\nWhy it matters:\nThis guides which ingredients are included in the dataset and how they\u2019re evaluated for similarity \u2014 a technical but crucial layer.\nRank: Very Important\n4. How do customer preferences (e.g., taste vs. health) influence their acceptance of plant-based dishes?\nThis affects how recommendations are ranked or filtered based on user intent.\nSub-questions:\nWhat attributes do customers prioritize when ordering plant-based meals?\nDo preferences differ across demographics or restaurant types?\n5. What\u2019s the most effective way to present plant-based recommendations to chefs and restaurant managers?\n"

The testable elements at this stage are whether the problem is clearly defined, whether the proposed features are understandable and appealing, and whether the initiative feels relevant to the intended audience. The main areas still to be developed are the visual representation of the platform flow, details on potential user testing methods, and a clearer sustainability plan. I would most value feedback on the clarity of the problem framing, the usefulness of the proposed features, and any major gaps you notice. Based on this feedback, I plan to refine the structure, add visuals, and begin early outreach to potential collaborators for validation.\n\n"

                        "answer": "1. Manual Coding Takes More Time Than Expected\nThe most immediate obstacle has been the time required to manually code and annotate a sufficient number of articles across multiple outlets and topics. Because each paragraph must be carefully reviewed, labeled for primary and secondary frames, and have interpretive notes attached, progress has been slower than anticipated. \nUnconventional Workaround:\nInstead of attempting to finish all manual coding upfront, I could adopt a rolling annotation approach, where I code a smaller \u201cseed\u201d batch of 10\u201315 articles first and begin experimenting with GPT prompts using this partial dataset. As the GPT prompts are refined, I can add more annotated articles incrementally. Essentially, this means the dataset and prompt design evolve in parallel rather than sequentially.\n\n2. Designing GPT Prompts That Yield Consistent Outputs\nOne challenge is that large language models like GPT are sensitive to prompt design. Even small changes in phrasing or example ordering can lead to significant variation in outputs. While this flexibility is an advantage for interpretive analysis, it is also a risk because the project\u2019s value depends on being able to produce reliable, explainable outputs.\nOne unconventional option would be to use chain-of-thought prompting combined with \u201cinstruction-locking.\u201d In other words, I could first ask GPT to explain, in plain language, which frame(s) it sees in the text and why (the chain of thought). Then, in a second step, I could explicitly instruct it to extract the labels in a structured . This two-step process may reduce variability because it separates reasoning from final labeling. \n\n3.  Deciding Whether to Include the Regression Layer\nThe third blocker is strategic: whether to incorporate a simple linear regression layer to quantify how frame patterns predict ideological leaning. On one hand, this adds analytical depth and shows an innovative blend of qualitative and quantitative methods. On the other hand, collecting reliable target labels for ideological bias, formatting GPT outputs consistently, and building a regression model could stretch the project beyond what is realistically achievable within the timeframe. \nInstead of fully committing to regression, I could treat it as a bonus experiment."

                        "answer": "-Computational Limitation:\nRunning benchmark tests to see how speciesist different LLMs are can quickly become super expensive. The papers I\u2019ve read so far usually rely on tons of questions and prompts to evaluate how well the models respond. Doing all of this multiple can cost a lot of money. It also makes the whole process slower, since it\u2019s harder to run experiments multiple times when each one costs money.\n\nUnconventional Workaround:\nInstead of using thousands of prompts and spending tons on big models right away, I can design my benchmark to be smaller but smarter. I\u2019d focus on fewer, carefully chosen scenarios that really test for key issues related to speciesism, making sure each question reveals something valuable, focusing on quality over quantity.\n\nAlso, instead of immediately using expensive, top-tier models, I can start with free or cheap open-source models . After I have a solid setup, I can then selectively use more expensive models just to validate or finalize the results.\n\nPerson/Resource:\nThere are lots of researchers online who share their insights regarding keeping the costs down that I can learn from\n\n\n\n-Failing to come up with an improved benchmark compared to existing research:\nThere\u2019s a possibility that my benchmark ends up not being clearly better or adding much compared to existing work, especially since researchers have already started exploring this area and have come up with some decent methods. If my benchmark is too similar or doesn\u2019t show noticeable improvements, it might not stand out or feel worth the effort.\n\nUnconventional Workaround:\nOne way around this is to combine strengths from multiple existing benchmarksto form a stronger, more robust evaluation. Instead of inventing everything from scratch, I\u2019d mix and match the effective parts from current benchmarks into something unique.\n\nAlternatively, I could shift my project\u2019s main angle altogether. Rather than just trying to beat existing speciesism benchmarks, I might focus on comparing how speciesism shows up differently in models trained in various languages. This approach would allow me to contribute unique insights without competing directly against established benchmark\n\nPerson/Resource:\nNiki Dupuis\nPrishita Shukla"

Most datasets are basic images of animals for classification or basic emotions. Monitoring animal behaviour consist of combining the animals' facial expressions (and their affective state inferred from them), their pose estimation, and tracking their movements and behaviours over time. It is even more complicated to monitor health and flagging deviations from normal behaviour, you would have to teach the model how these symptoms manifest and even how the specific combinations of symptoms could indicate a problem. A lot of the available resources, datasets, and pre-trained models focus on farmed animals or wild animals in terms of computer vision (e.g. YOLO11). \n- unconventional workaround: I asked Perplexity some ideas of a workaround, it suggests transfer learning, adapting pre-trained models with more abundant resources (e.g. horses, mice, humans) to cats and dogs. Another one that appealed to me is deploying basic models in shelters for active learning. \n- I'd like to ask our mentor Sam if this is even feasible with limited resources (especially since I do not have a technical background, but my partner does and he's helping me with it), or maybe I should focus my efforts on developing a AI tool for streamlined adoption process with matchmaking element instead. \n\n2. Problem scoping: maybe this is not something that helps shelters most and I should my diverting my focus to doing something that immediately helps shelters and provide something they actually need. I have reached out to some local shelters but I haven't heard something back, I'm thinking of visiting some in person for a quick meeting to gauge the priorities and get some quick feedback on ideas. So going to shelters directly would be a resource. I am also meeting a connection made through the fellowship who works in software product design but is also close with animal sanctuaries and shelters so she can offer me some insights as well. \n"

While it was exciting to see how many options were available, this quickly became overwhelming. Each tool had different features, learning curves, pricing models and output styles. As a result, we lost time trying to test all of them instead of selecting a smaller, manageable set from the start.\nWhy It Was a Problem:\nIt slowed down execution. We were stuck in the testing phase for too long.\nIt created confusion when comparing outputs from different tools.\nIt was difficult to ensure consistency across videos when using different platforms.\nUnconventional Workaround:\nInstead of aiming for the \u201cbest\u201d tool, we could adopt a minimum viable tool stack approach: pick one tool per function (e.g., one for video generation, one for editing, one for voice), then stick with those throughout the project. This would force decisions early and reduce complexity.\nWe could also assign each team member a specific tool to master, then share best practices internally\u2014turning confusion into collective expertise.\nPerson/Resource That Could Help:\nA teammate who has already tested several tools could lead a 15-minute crash course/demo.\nOnline comparison resources e.g. YouTube reviews or product comparisons on sites could help us assess tools quickly based on use case and ease of use.\n\n\n"

Coordinating schedules, waiting for responses, and navigating busy calendars can cause significant delays in gathering the insights and feedback I need to build a strong foundation for my prototype.\nUnconventional Workaround:\nTo workaround the issue, I pre-selected pool of potential contacts with tailored questions ready for each type of stakeholder. I will schedule interviews ad hoc as people become available. Additionally, I can offer an alternative: sending the interview questions via email or in voice message format, which may encourage faster responses.\nPeople/Resources:\nI\u2019m tapping into extended networks through friends, colleagues, and mutual contacts to broaden the pool of potential interviewees. I\u2019m also considering launching a survey on dedicated forums, pages, or a dedicated LinkedIn post.\n\nBlocker 2: Lack of technical skills to build the tool\nA major blocker is my limited technical ability. I am not equipped to develop or simulate an AI-powered tool with backend functionality or advanced interactivity, which makes building a fully operational prototype impossible within the current scope.\nUnconventional Workaround:\nRather than attempting to build the actual tool, I will focus on creating a detailed, visual prototype using no-code platforms like Google Sheets or else. I can design a mockup that simulates the navigation and user flow to effectively demonstrate how the tool would work. To strengthen the pitch, I will develop comprehensive instructions, data flows, and potential use cases, which could later serve as a blueprint for a developer to build the tool.\nPeople/Resources: I am consulting friends with experience in the field for advice on the most intuitive platforms to use. I\u2019m going to put a message in the cohort Slack to gather advice from my peers. Tutorials are also a great resource for learning basic skills that will enable me to present a more complete prototype within my capabilities."

Everyone sticks to decision. \n1 person/resource that could help - Contact someone who has looked at the topic (e.g. Walter Veit) and ask for their advice.  \n\nBlocker 2 - Team member falls ill and can't perform their task\n1 unconventional solution - ask ChatGPT to pick up workload of sick team member. (Conventional solution: Ask group whether anyone else can pick up the workload. Another option - narrow scope of paper to something more manageable with a smaller team). \n1 person/resource that could help - Generative AI to perform/allocate tasks. \n"

                        "answer": "\n [slide 2 - picture of happy animals on AI farm] AI has the potential to radically improve the welfare of farm animals. It can be used to detect diseases early on, identify when animals are hungry and respond accordingly, and better help farmers understand when farm animals experience pain, stress, or discomfort. [slide 2 - picture of miserable animals on AI farm] But AI also has the potential to significantly worsen farm animal welfare. It could make mistakes and cause great suffering as a result, decrease our empathy and concern towards farm animals, and lead to further intensification and cramped living conditions. [slide 3] Our paper seeks to address these concerns by identifying the major welfare risks associated with AI enhanced livestock farming, and providing clear, well-researched, and practical guidelines for addressing these risks.\n [slide 4] In doing so, we hope to fill in several gaps in the literature. While some papers have already touched on some of the animal welfare risks associated with precision-livestock farming (PLF), little attention has been paid to the risks that stem from AI enhanced PLF in particular. Furthermore, we believe that much more can, and should, be said about what solutions will address these risks, and the practical steps that can be taken to resolve these issues.\n [slide 5] So what can you do?
